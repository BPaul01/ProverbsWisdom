{"Question": "What are some common sources that Christians turn to for guidance on various aspects of life besides the Bible?", "Answer": "People  desperately  want  to  \"win\"  at  life.

They look to Dr. Phil or Oprah or Dear Abby or Delilah After Dark or Intelligence for Life by John Tesh. If you have to look to John Tesh for intelligence on life, you're in trouble!

If the king is wise,  the  people  will  be  wise;  but  if  the  king  is  unwise,  the  people  will  be foolish. There is a need for a wise king who can produce a wise nation-a wise kingdom.  Throughout  Israel's  history  the  foolishness  of  the  kings  led  to  the difficulties and ultimately the destruction of the kingdom. The kings were fools, so the people were fools. As a result, there was death and chaos. "}
{"Question": "What implications does the text suggest about the interplay between the wisdom of a king and the wisdom of the people, and how does this affect the overall well-being of the kingdom?", "Answer": "Wisdom Is Royal (1:1) These are the proverbs of Solomon, \"son of David, king of Israel.\" Wisdom is royal because it's how kings rule their people. In 1 Kings 3:9 Solomon asks God for wisdom, which was for him the ability to rule well as king of Israel. He says, \"So  give  your  servant  a  receptive  heart  to  judge  your  people  and  to  discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?\" And in Proverbs 8:15-16 Wisdom states, \"It is by me that kings reign and rulers enact just  law;  by  me,  princes  lead,  as  do  nobles  and  all  righteous  judges.\" Immediately Proverbs connects wisdom with the kingship and with the Messiah. \"Son  of  David\"  is  a  messianic  title.  The  Son  of  David  will  establish  God's eternal kingdom on earth, but he can only do it through wisdom-through justice (see 2 Sam 7; Isa 11). In Proverbs, Solomon is training his \"son\" in wisdom so that  he  can  establish  the  messianic  kingdom.  As  we  will  see,  he  is  also instructing the youth of the nation in wisdom in hopes of producing it in them as well. But the king embodies the nation and represents the nation. If the king is wise,  the  people  will  be  wise;  but  if  the  king  is  unwise,  the  people  will  be foolish. There is a need for a wise king who can produce a wise nation-a wise kingdom.

{"Question": "What is the significance of the fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil appearing desirable to Adam and Eve, and how does this relate to the theme of wisdom in the text?", "Answer": "Adam and Eve are prohibited access to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden. Why? God forbids them to eat that fruit not because he's giving them an arbitrary rule to break so that one day he can send his Son to die for sinners and save us from hell. He wants to teach humanity to depend on God for that knowledge instead of determining it for ourselves. God determines what  is  good  and  what  is  evil;  that's  not  for  us  to  decide.  So  we  fear  him  by submitting  to  his  Word.  However,  humans  decided  to  trust  the  voice  of  the serpent and what their \"own eyes\" said was best. Adam and Eve sought wisdom apart  from  God  and  his  Word.  That's  foolishness.

{"Question": "In what way does the text emphasize the importance of a reverential relationship with the Lord in gaining wisdom according to Proverbs?", "Answer": "You Get Wisdom by Reverent Trust in the Lord (1:7) How  can  we  be  wise  like  this?  How  can  we  learn  to  read  situations  and  make wise  decisions?  How  do  you  get  this  multifaceted  wisdom?  As  we  will  see throughout the book, Solomon says that all wisdom is \"religious\" or spiritual in nature  because  it's  only  through  a  relationship  with  the  Lord  that  one  can  be wise.  The  fear  of-the  reverence  for-Yahweh  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and discipline, but the wise person is the one who fears, trusts, and reverences Yahweh. This is the first step and the essential component in gaining wisdom-the fear of the Lord.

Some scholars solve this tension-their observation of cases to the contrary-by saying that the proverbs are just rules that are generally true but not always true. So they say these are not promises, just how things work out most times. That's not the whole story. The proverbs are promises. The proverbs will always come true. You can bank on them. We need to understand this about the proverbs. Proverbs are promises that generally come  true  now  but  always  come  true  later.  They  are  generally  true  in  this  life, but they are absolutely true in the life to come. Eventually these will come true even if they don't come true immediately.5 Again, wisdom is an order by which God made the world and behind which he stands to make sure that it happens. We see this in God's Word. Achan's greed was found out pretty quickly, and it cost him and his family their lives ( Josh 7). Ahab and Jezebel's greedy murder of Naboth to take possession of his vineyard didn't cost them their lives for years after their sin, but it did cost them their lives eventually (1 Kgs 22; 2 Kgs 9).

{"Question": "How does the text suggest that the consequences of greed can manifest in both the present and the future?", "Answer": "So naked greed will destroy you-sometimes now and sometimes later.

Your greed may run your family into the ground, and you not see the toll it takes on your wife and kids for years to come; but eventually you will see it. But even if none of those things is uncovered in this life, they will be at the judgment. Any discomfort  you  feel  right  now  for  your  greed  is  only  a  tiny  foretaste  of  the ultimate  judgment  to  come  in  hell  (see  Rev  20:11-15,  the  Great  White  Throne Judgment). "}

{"Question": "What emotions did the speaker and the teenagers experience during the incident at the marketplace, involving the trip leader's outburst?", "Answer": "S everal  years  ago  I  (  Jon)  went  on  a  mission  trip  to  a  country  in  Southeast Asia. We would travel from place to place preaching the gospel, and then at lunchtime  we  would  stop  in  an  open  air  market  to  eat.  Our  trip  leader  was  a passionate evangelist, so after we had time to eat he would appoint someone to stand up on our jeep and use a megaphone to preach the gospel to the hundreds of  people  in  the  marketplace.  One  day  I  was  chosen  to  preach,  so  I  got  on  the jeep and as passionately as I could I gave the gospel. At the end of my sermon I invited anyone who wanted to respond to the gospel to come forward to talk with me. No one came, so I prepared to get down off the jeep. Our trip leader looked at me and motioned with his hand for me to continue to preach. So I preached for  a  few  more  minutes,  gave  the  invitation  and  no  one  came.  Our  leader motioned for me to keep going. This went on for several minutes. Finally, some teenage  boys  who  were  watching  me  began  to  laugh  at  me.  This  enraged  our group leader. He snatched the megaphone from me and walked toward the boys and shouted with a red face, \"You think this is funny! God is gonna laugh at you in  hell  one  day!\"  I  was  shocked,  and  so  were  the  teenagers.  It  was  quite  the scene. "}
{"Question": "How can the threat of hell be misused in attempts to influence others, according to the text?", "Answer": "Hellfire and brimstone preaching can be harsh, and there are definitely wrong ways  to  do  it.

If you are hasty with your words, you will lose friends. This is the way the world works; and if you ignore that, you will wreck your life. "}
{"Question": "How does the text emphasize the importance of God's wisdom in guiding human behavior and choices?", "Answer": "God made everything, he knows how it works, and he reveals that to us because he loves us and wants what it best for us. The things he lays out in Proverbs are not  his  way  of  raining  on  our  parade  but  rather  his  way  of  telling  his  beloved children how life works best. We end up hurting ourselves, this text says, when we choose autonomy from God. It's not just that sin is wrong, although it is, but sin is also destructive. In the end, the Lord will see to it that his order works out. Proverbs  24:12  says,  \"Won't  he  repay  a  person  according  to  his  work?\"  So refusing the wisdom of this book (i.e., refusing Jesus), as we all have, will wreck your life now and/or later.

{"Question": "How is foolishness equated with rebellion against God in Proverbs, leading to consequences that extend beyond physical death?", "Answer": "The wages of foolishness is death. The judgment for unfaithfulness to the Lord is  death  (1:32).  The  \"apostasy\"  (abandoning  of  the  Lord)  of  the  inexperienced will kill them. This word apostasy is used in Jeremiah and Hosea for cheating on the  Lord  (  Jer  2:19;  Hos  14:4).  Foolishness  isn't  about  mental  capacity;  it's rebellion against God. The sentence for that is death. In the immediate context of Proverbs 1:32-33, this means the \"death\" of exile for Israel. And for us, in the scheme of the whole Bible, it means eternal banishment in hell. The really sad part of verse 32 is that it talks of the \"complacency\" of fools. We can be lulled into a false sense of security thinking that everything is fine. We can think that our folly is not that big a deal. \"This isn't something I need to worry about right now; I've got plenty of time to address that.\" We often don't recognize that our behavior, which we think may just be a minor character flaw, is a rebellion that will ultimately destroy us.

{"Question": "How does the text emphasize the importance of listening to God's warnings and instructions for our own well-being?", "Answer": "God warns us and instructs us to keep us from harming ourselves-not to keep us from having fun.

As Solomon does, we need to observe the world around us and see how it works. Solomon looks at ants and is instructed (6:6-8). We need to do this as well, but we do it through the fear of the Lord-through dependence on God and his Word. And as we seek, God grants more to us. James 1:5 says that  if  we  lack  wisdom  we  should  ask  the  Lord  for  it  because  he  gives  it generously. Solomon already knows this because he asked the Lord for it (1 Kgs 3).

Proverbs  30:20  says,  \"This  is  the  way  of  an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI've done nothing wrong.'\" People can find all kinds of ways to justify their sin as if it's not wrong. \"It's OK for me to flirt with this woman at work because my wife doesn't respond to me the  way  that  she  should.\"  With  our  mouths  we  justify  and  rationalize  and minimize our sin or the sins of others. Any person who will counsel you in such a way as to justify sin in your life is someone of perverse speech that should be avoided. They are leading you down dark paths, and they rejoice in evil (2:13- 14). "}

{"Question": "What is the initial approach the woman in Proverbs takes to potentially lead a man into unfaithfulness?", "Answer": "How  does  this  woman  work?  She  flatters  with  her  words.

{"Question": "How does the concept of Jesus embodying Wisdom intertwine with his role as the obedient Son?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus is not only the Wisdom of Proverbs, but he is also the Son who perfectly listens  to  his  Father,  perfectly  keeps  the  covenant,  and  avoids  immorality. However,  in  the  end,  Jesus  takes  the  penalty  that  covenant-breakers  like  us deserve. He went down into death for sexual sinners like us, but three days later he  triumphantly  returned  to  the  paths  of  life!  Through  his  life,  death,  and resurrection he has defeated all of our enemies. It is not inevitable that they will drag  you  down  to  death.  He  can  rescue  you  from  them  by  empowering  you  to walk  in  wisdom.  It  is  not  inevitable  that  they  will  cause  your  exile  from  God forever. Jesus came out of death to inherit the whole earth, and you can be his coheir  if  you  are  united  to  him  by  faith.  If  you  find  yourself  giving  in  to  evil, consistently  rationalizing  your  sin,  or  being  enslaved  to  sexual  sin,  then circumstances may be revealing to you that you're not listening to the voice of Wisdom. You have, instead, been seduced by the voice of another. If that's true, come  to  Jesus-the  Wisdom  of  God-and  follow  his  leading  voice!  Listen  to him. He has the words that lead to life. "}

Because  he  loves  us  just  like  parents  who  discipline their child out of love. He loves you enough to allow hardship at times to prepare you for something greater later. He loves us and wants to make us like Jesus, so that means discipline (cf. Heb 12-he allows suffering to produce holiness). So yes, God will reward us, but he doesn't always give us what we want when we want  it.  Instead,  he  gives  us  exactly  what  we  need  when  we  need  it.  He  will conform you to the image of his covenant-keeping Son so that you are the kind of  person  who  can  rightly  experience  the  covenant  blessings.  Sometimes  you will  suffer  now  and  not  receive  an  immediate  reward  because  the  Lord  is molding you for a greater glory later. "}

{"Question": "How does Solomon's advice to seek Wisdom in Proverbs align with the idea of seeking Jesus above all else?", "Answer": "Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  treasure  that  is  superior  to  all  that  we  can  set  our hearts on. Solomon will tell us in Proverbs 3:13-35 to seek Wisdom first, above all  else.  When  Solomon  wrote  these  words  he  was  encouraging  his  son  to commit to study this book-Proverbs. But in the fullness of time, the Spirit has revealed to us that Wisdom is a person-Jesus Christ. We are to seek him-the pearl of great price-above all else, and all these other things will be provided for us (Matt 6:33). If we set our supreme desire on things-even good things-it will  prove  disappointing.  It  may  even  wreck  our  lives.

{"Question": "What does the personification of wisdom as a beautiful woman signify in the context of the text?", "Answer": "Proverbs 3:13-18 is a poem or a hymn about the supreme value of wisdom.

{"Question": "How does the text convey the superiority of wisdom over material possessions such as silver, gold, or jewels?", "Answer": "Wisdom's profits are better than silver, gold, or jewels. Wisdom is better than money  and  stuff.  Wisdom  is  better  because  it  cannot  be  lost  or  destroyed  (see Matt 6; moth and rust destroy money and stuff). Wisdom is better because, as we saw  in  verses  1-12,  it  shapes  you  into  the  kind  of  person  who  can  enjoy  these things in the proper context. To paraphrase Waltke, money can put food on the table  but  not  fellowship  around  it.  Money  can  buy  you  a  house,  but  it  cannot produce  a  home.  Money  can  give  a  woman  jewelry,  but  it  cannot  buy  her  real love  (Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  257).  Wisdom  is  better  than  that.  Wisdom  gives physical,  spiritual,  and  relational  blessings.

{"Question": "How does the concept of wisdom in Proverbs challenge the notion that daily life details are morally neutral?", "Answer": "Solomon  blows  this  paradigm  apart  in  Proverbs.  The  nitty-gritty  details  of your  daily  life  are  not  morally  neutral.  That's  the  whole  point  of  Proverbs. Wisdom isn't first and foremost tips for daily living that you follow; Wisdom is a person that you know and a path that you then walk.

If you have a temper problem, you love to argue with people, you go too far with your girlfriend, or you can't see a task your boss assigns you through to completion, those are not just minor character  flaws.

{"Question": "How does Solomon convey the importance of wisdom as a guide to ethical living in Proverbs 1:10-19?", "Answer": "In verses 10-19 Solomon again exhorts his son to listen to his wise teaching in order  to  prolong  his  life  (v.  10).

Solomon says that since his son has embraced Wisdom, now he must  stay  on  the  path  of  wisdom,  that  is,  the  path  of  morality  and  the  safest course (v. 12). Keep hold of Wisdom, and she will be your life (v. 13). Do not walk  on  the  wicked  path  (v.  14).  Again,  wisdom  is  not  intelligence,  and foolishness  is  not  morally  neutral.

There are sin patterns that we try to break but can't. We try to modify the behavior. We say, \"It's bad, so stop it!\" We may even put guards in place that help for a little while, but eventually the guards are not enough. For example,  you  recognize  that  you  have  a  porn  problem  so  you  put  guarding software on your computer to keep you from going to those sites. Things go well for a little while, but then you learn to get around the software, or you look at it on your phone. Or you've got a problem with your temper. You explode in anger at your children. So in order to modify the behavior, you decide you'll count to ten  before  responding  to  anything.  But  sometimes  you  forget  to  count  because you're just so angry. "}

{"Question": "How does the pastor's analogy of mowing dandelions shed light on the limitations of behavior modification?", "Answer": "Why  don't  these  things  work?  As  one  pastor  said,  behavior  modification  is like mowing dandelions. You can mow over the dandelions, and your lawn will look good; but a day or two later the dandelions have popped up again because you didn't address the root. Behavior modification treats the surface issue, but it does not dig down to the source. The problem is in our heart-that is the source. If  we  do  not  deal  with  sin  and  foolishness  at  the  heart  level,  then  even  if  we mightily try to modify the behavior, it will find new ways to pop out in our lives. So if you have a problem with addiction to alcohol, your primary problem is a lack of self-control. You may modify the alcoholism, but if you do not address the  root  issue  of  self-control,  the  alcohol  problem  will  come  back  or  the  self- control issue will resurface with smoking, overeating, or taking painkillers.

{"Question": "How does Solomon's narrative in Proverbs 7 illustrate the dangers of flirting with temptation and indulging in sinful desires?", "Answer": "In  Proverbs  7  Solomon  gives  a  story  that  focuses  on  this  woman's  smooth words.  From  his  house,  Solomon  watches  a  na\u00c3\u00afve  young  man.  He  sees  him flirting with sexual sin by going close to this woman's house (7:7-8). So many of us  ask  those  kinds  of  questions:  \"Where's  the  line?  How  far  is  too  far?  How close can I get without going too far?\" Solomon tells his son to keep far from her -flee from this temptation (5:8). But he is in the wrong place at the wrong time with  the  wrong  person,  so  the  wrong  thing  happens.  She  flatters  him  with  her words:  \"You're  the  one  for  me.  I've  gotta  have  you,  big  boy\"  (7:13-18).  She inflates  his  ego  perhaps  in  a  way  that  his  wife  hasn't.

{"Question": "What are the temporal consequences of sexual sin that Solomon cautions against in Proverbs 5:9-14 and 6:26-35?", "Answer": "Sexual Sin Will Destroy You with Temporal Consequences (5:9-14; 6:26-35) Solomon warns his son of the temporal consequences of sexual sin. There will be a death, so to speak, right now. You will reap what you've sown. Anyone can see these consequences, even non-believers. Solomon is actually talking in 5:9- 14 about the forbidden woman's pimp or her husband taking revenge, but these consequences are generic enough to apply to all of us. They seem very similar to the  covenant  curses  of  Deuteronomy  28.  When  you  obey  God  you  will experience blessings that you did not work for, but when you disobey him even what you have worked for will go to another. You will give the best part of you to someone it does not belong to (Prov 5:10). You will waste your time, energy, and  resources.  Porn  is  a  current  example  of  an  incredible  waste  of  time  when you could have been producing or providing for your family. Solomon says you will lose your money (in modern cases, alimony and child support).

Sexual intimacy binds you together with your spouse in a way you are not bound with anyone else. You must develop this part of your marriage.  Meet  your  spouse's  needs  rather  than  insisting  on  your  needs  being met  (Phil  2:3-5).  Practically:  Do  not  sleep  in  separate  rooms.  Do  getaways without the children.

{"Question": "How does the father in Proverbs 1-9 emphasize the choice between following Wisdom and embracing Folly for the son?", "Answer": "The whole point of Proverbs 1-9 is the father trying to get the son to be in a relationship with Wisdom instead of Folly.

Whom  will  you  choose  to  marry?\"  You  cannot  walk  in wisdom in terms of sexual ethics if you are not in a right relationship with Jesus.

{"Question": "Can we draw a connection between trustworthiness in personal affairs and adherence to Jesus's invitation based on the text's implications?", "Answer": "This has huge implications for your life right now-for the nitty-gritty details of your life.

{"Question": "How does the personification of Wisdom in the text relate to Solomon's wisdom and God's Wisdom?", "Answer": "Wisdom built her house, and it is a temple because it's at the highest point of the city  (v.  3).

{"Question": "When it comes to correction and speaking up, what is emphasized as a key aspect of wisdom in the text?", "Answer": "So  according  to  these  verses,  wisdom  is  the  discernment  to  know  whom  to correct and whom not to correct. You do this by discerning the outcome. How will your correction be received? This is wisdom. Since Jesus is the Wisdom of God,  that  means  being  formed  into  Christlikeness  is  not  just  growing  in  a reduction  of  sinfulness,  although  that  is  part  of  it.  It  is  also  growth  in discernment. Being like Jesus means having the ability to see the situation you are in. It means recognizing when to correct people and when not to correct them because it will only make things worse. It also means knowing when not to play the coward and to speak up and say something in the right situation. "}

I hope Proverbs 10 will reveal to you the areas of your life where you are a fool and sinful, and then will drive you to Jesus Christ as your Savior. Then, through faith in Christ, the wisdom of Proverbs is what God will produce in your life  daily.

Instead, we may talk about a hundred different things as we go through the day. We will talk to them about things from the mundane to the sublime, like how to throw  a  baseball,  how  to  drive  a  car,  how  to  do  a  job  interview,  how  to  spend money  wisely,  how  to  handle  a  conflict  with  a  friend,  how  to  handle  dating issues, how to improve their prayer life-all kinds of things. We go through our day,  and  as  conversations  and  topics  come  up,  we  have  the  responsibility  to teach our children. That is what's happening in Proverbs. Solomon says that as you  go  throughout  the  day,  conversations  will  come  up  about  all  kinds  of different  topics,  and  you  need  to  be  ready  to  instruct  your  children  and  impart wisdom to them.

{"Question": "How does the teaching approach in Proverbs emphasize the organic and continuous nature of imparting wisdom to children throughout daily conversations and experiences?", "Answer": "What  we  see  differently  starting  in  chapter  10  is  how  random  everything  is now.  Let  me  talk  to  you  about  being  a  wise  son,  then  let's  talk  about  money, then let's talk about laziness, then let's talk about the blessing of the Lord, then let's  talk  about  how  you  use  your  mouth,  and  then  let's  talk  about  how  you discipline  your  children.  It  is  all  over  the  place  and  scattershot.  We  should  not think this is by accident. The reason it is random is because the book of Proverbs is  Solomon  obeying  the  command  to  parents  in  Deuteronomy  6  to  teach  their children the law.20 God gave very specific commands to the parents about how to teach their children the law. He said you do it when they wake up, when they sit, when they walk along the road, and when they lie down. How much of your day is given to waking up, sitting, walking around, and lying down? The entire day!  That  is  the  point.  He  is  saying  that  your  task  as  a  parent  is  to  teach  your children the law throughout the day. How does that work? For those of you who are parents, do you sit children down one day and say, \"OK. Let me map out our week.  Monday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  marriage and  dating  and  romance  (most  of  you  probably  do  not  have  a  lot  of  material here).  Tuesday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  work. Wednesday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  how  to communicate.\" And so on.

{"Question": "What are the consequences of laziness according to Solomon's teachings, beyond just material impoverishment?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  two  things:  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty  and  shaming  your parents,  while  diligence  and  hard  work  lead  to  riches  where  you  are  able  to provide  and  bring  joy  to  your  parents.  Again,  wisdom  is  about  the  effect  your actions  have  on  you  and  the  people  around  you.  The  problem  is  that  hardly anyone confesses that they are a lazy person. No one has ever walked into my office  for  counseling  and  said,  \"I'm  really  wrestling  with  laziness.\"  No  one thinks  they  are  lazy  because  the  picture  of  laziness  in  their  mind  is  the  couch potato who watches soap operas all day long while eating Klondike bars in their bathrobe. In Proverbs, laziness refers to people who cannot see their assignments through to completion (see Moore, \"Finding Jesus\"). They might start a task and get to the middle of it, but they walk away before it is finished. It's the son who helped  plant  the  crops  but  is  not  there  during  harvest  to  finish  the  task.  In  our day, the laziness of Proverbs looks like distractions that keep you from staying on task. You cannot complete your assignments because Facebook distracts you for thirty minutes. You come back and do five minutes of work, but then check Twitter for fifteen minutes. Laziness is seen in the extended adolescence of our culture where kids can't grow up and provide for themselves but keep ending up back  at  Mom  and  Dad's  house  (bringing  shame  to  their  parents,  even  if  the parents  won't  admit  it).  Laziness  keeps  you  from  providing  for  your  family  or from the ability to have a family, and the failure to provide for your family is a failure to believe the gospel-it's a Jesus problem (cf. 1 Tim 5:8).

It's the son who helped  plant  the  crops  but  is  not  there  during  harvest  to  finish  the  task.  In  our day, the laziness of Proverbs looks like distractions that keep you from staying on task. You cannot complete your assignments because Facebook distracts you for thirty minutes. You come back and do five minutes of work, but then check Twitter for fifteen minutes. Laziness is seen in the extended adolescence of our culture where kids can't grow up and provide for themselves but keep ending up back  at  Mom  and  Dad's  house  (bringing  shame  to  their  parents,  even  if  the parents  won't  admit  it).  Laziness  keeps  you  from  providing  for  your  family  or from the ability to have a family, and the failure to provide for your family is a failure to believe the gospel-it's a Jesus problem (cf. 1 Tim 5:8).

{"Question": "In what ways does laziness manifest in modern society, as described in the text?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  two  things:  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty  and  shaming  your parents,  while  diligence  and  hard  work  lead  to  riches  where  you  are  able  to provide  and  bring  joy  to  your  parents.  Again,  wisdom  is  about  the  effect  your actions  have  on  you  and  the  people  around  you.  The  problem  is  that  hardly anyone confesses that they are a lazy person. No one has ever walked into my office  for  counseling  and  said,  \"I'm  really  wrestling  with  laziness.\"  No  one thinks  they  are  lazy  because  the  picture  of  laziness  in  their  mind  is  the  couch potato who watches soap operas all day long while eating Klondike bars in their bathrobe.

{"Question": "How does the concept of God's sovereignty challenge the traditional notion of absolute free will?", "Answer": "The concept of God's sovereignty makes us uncomfortable because \"I've got free  will,  and  God  can't  infringe  on  my  choices,  otherwise  it's  not  free  will.\" Well, yes, you do have free will, and no, you really don't. There is no such thing as absolute free will. There are two biblical reasons we understand that our free will is not absolute, that we cannot do anything we want to do. First, your will is constrained by your nature. You can only make choices in accordance with your nature. For example, I'm free to dunk a basketball, but I ( Jon) cannot because I lack  the  ability  in  my  nature.  Since  you  are  a  sinner  by  nature,  you  cannot choose not to sin. It is inevitable that you will sin, regardless of how much you might not want to sin. While we might have the natural ability to make certain choices, our sin nature constricts us morally from actually doing it. "}

{"Question": "How does the text illustrate the concept of divine sovereignty in the face of human actions and intentions?", "Answer": "God  is  supremely  sovereign:  he  ordains  everything  that  happens  (without being the author of evil; see Jas 1:13).

God  can  turn  the suffering  in  our  lives  into  something  really  good  for  his  glory  and  our  good (Rom 8:28).

Either it means that God has created the wicked for destruction or that even the punishment  of  the  wicked  is  part  of  his  plan.  Whichever  option  you  take,  the Bible is clear that God is not the author of evil. It seems to best fit the flow of the passage if we interpret this verse as meaning that God uses human rebellion for his good purposes (as Longman argues, Proverbs, 329). "}

His sovereignty means that the suffering and chaos in your life is not meaningless or ultimate. You may not see how in the world what is happening to you could ever be a good thing, and you may never understand it until eternity, but you can trust that a God who did not remain distant from your suffering-but rather entered into your world, suffered even beyond what you are suffering, and died in your place-has a good reason and plan for why he is allowing all these things  to  happen  in  your  life.  Plus,  one  day  he  will  do  away  with  evil  and suffering forever. Revelation 21-22 is on the way! "}

{"Question": "How does the absence of God in Proverbs 16:8 tie into the notion of righteousness and wealth as presented in the text?", "Answer": "God  makes  sure  that  things  work  out  in  the  end.  Proverbs  16:8  is  the  only verse in 16:1-9 that does not mention God. We think there is a reason for that.

It  says, \"Better a little with righteousness than great income with injustice.\" It is better to be poor and righteous than to be rich having gotten your money in a sinful way. This verse is a qualification. Generally in Proverbs the righteous get rich and the wicked  become  poor,  but  Solomon  says  it  doesn't  always  work  out  that  way. There  will  be  times  when  the  wicked  become  enriched  because  of  their wickedness, and there are times when the righteous will be poor because of their righteousness. In those times, you will be tempted to think God is absent and not involved, but he is still working all things together for his good purposes. There may be a season where it looks like evil is winning and things are not working out the way they should.

Those  who practice wickedness-like the  merchants with unfair weights-are  abhorrent  to the king ( just like the wicked of v. 5 are repulsive to Yahweh). It is detestable to the  king  because  his  dynasty-his  throne-will  only  last  if  he  reigns  in righteousness  and  justice.  This  is  the  point  of  Proverbs.  Solomon  attempts  to train  his  son  to  be  the  ideal  king  who  sets  up  the  messianic  kingdom  by righteousness. Solomon wants to be a Deuteronomy 6 parent who trains his son in the law so that his son can become a Deuteronomy 17 king who is a man of the law. The problem is Solomon and all of his descendants fail, and this leads to the hope in Israel for a king who embodies the wisdom of Proverbs (Isa 11:1-5) and  who  can  finally  establish  the  eternal,  Davidic  kingdom.  This  is  fulfilled  in the Messiah Jesus.24 Jesus sets up a kingdom where there is no wickedness or injustice.  He  establishes  his  eternal  kingdom  in  righteousness  by  judging  the wicked. Goldsworthy notes this as well: "}

Thus,  the  king-fulfilled  in Messiah Jesus-is to be judge and punisher. Life and death are in his hands just like  they  are  in  Yahweh's  hands.

Doing  what  is  right  in  your  own  eyes  leads  to  death (14:12).  Proverbs  teaches  that  God  gives  young  people  to  parents  who  are supposed  to  correct  this  condition.

{"Question": "How does the teacher differentiate between effective limit-setting and being wishy-washy in enforcing boundaries with children?", "Answer": "Another teacher I spoke with, a 58-year-old mother of grown children who has been teaching kindergarten for 17 years, told me she feels that parents are increasingly getting in the way of their children's development. \"I see the way their parents treat them,\" she said, \"and there's a big adjustment when they get into my class.

{"Question": "How can one maintain focus on Jesus during a conversation, as suggested in the text?", "Answer": "There  are  some  people  you  should  not  answer,  correct,  or  engage  in conversation.

But  Matthew  22:18 tells us, \"Perceiving their malicious intent, Jesus said, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcWhy are you testing me, hypocrites?'\" Jesus discerned the situation and knew how to answer about taxes, the resurrection of the dead, the greatest commandment, and David's Son so that Matthew 22:46 says, \"No one was able to answer him at all, and from that day no one dared to question him anymore.\" "}

{"Question": "How does the concept of wisdom relate to the growth and development of discernment in individuals, as exemplified by Jesus and his followers?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52), which means he grew in the ability to read people and situations.

We  see  this  with  the  deacon Stephen  at  his  trial;  the  opponents  could  not  resist  Stephen's  wisdom  (Acts 6:10). So if you are not growing in this ability, confess that to God, repent of it, and  go  to  Jesus.  Cry  out  to  him,  \"Lord,  show  me  where  I  lack  discernment. Judge  me  in  this  and  give  me  wisdom\"  (Moore,  Walking  the  Line).  Lack  of discernment might be because you are not a believer and need to trust Jesus for the first time.

{"Question": "How does Agur use the metaphor of a leech to illustrate the consequences of an uncontrolled appetite for material possessions?", "Answer": "Warnings about Uncontrolled Appetites First, Agur observes that the way the world works warns us about uncontrolled appetites  for  money,  sex,  and  status.  For  example,  verses  15-16  deal  with  an uncontrolled appetite for money. A leech is a literal bloodsucker that attaches to a host to drain resources and energy. Agur uses this metaphorically to talk about an uncontrolled appetite for stuff. We even use the term \"leech\" metaphorically for  someone  who  consumes  and  consumes  but  does  not  produce.  He  says  the leech  has  two  daughters,  referring  to  the  suckers  on  the  leech  by  which  it attaches  itself  and  drains  the  host  (see  Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31,  486-87). These  two  want  more  and  more  and  more.  The  dad  can  never  get  his  girls enough  stuff!  They  cannot  ever  be  satisfied.  They  always  want  a  little  more. They  can  be  just  like  Rockefeller,  who  was  asked  how  much  money  would  be enough,  and  he  replied,  \"Just  a  little  bit  more.\"  Agur's  point  is  to  warn  you  to avoid people who are like this and to warn you not to become like them because this is the path to destruction. Don't let a leech drain you of your time, money, and energy; and don't be a greedy person who constantly craves more and more. He observes four things in nature that are never satisfied to warn you that if you are not a content person then you will never be satisfied. Sheol is never satisfied because  the  grave  always  wants  one  more  dead  body.  The  childless  womb always craves a child-like Rachel who said, \"Give me sons, or I will die!\" (Gen 30:1). The land never gets enough water because after the rain the water soaks away. Fire always wants to rage out of control.

The  other three observations about things that move on or in something without leaving a trace  serve  the  final,  human  observation:  the  way  of  a  man  \"with\"  (though  the best translation like the other three is \"in\") a virgin or a young woman. This is talking of the proper context of sexual relations between a man and a woman in marriage.  Unlike,  say,  a  plow  or  a  sword,  these  four  things  involve  graceful movement and leave no damage or scar. "}
{"Question": "How does the behavior of the adulteress contrast with societal perceptions of sexual relations within marriage?", "Answer": "This fourth and final observation sets up the horrific nature of the next verse, which is the point.

The way  of  a  man  with  his  wife  provides  the  contrast  for  the  impropriety  of  the \"way\"  of  an  adulteress-sexual  relations  outside  of  marriage.  The  adulteress eats, wipes her mouth, and says, \"I've done nothing wrong.\" She acts as though she too leaves no damage or scar, but in fact she has done something wrong; her behavior  is  vulgar,  and  she  has  caused  grievous  damage.  Eating  is  a  metaphor for  sexual  sin.  She  wipes  her  mouth,  which  means  she  removes  the  trace  or evidence of her actions, and that is the connection with the four observations of nature. She goes on and forgets all about it. She treats sex like the common act of  eating  a  meal,  just  like  so  many  treat  sex  today.  They  say  it's  just  a  natural urge that you need to satisfy, just like you eat when you're hungry. They say if you repress it, you will harm yourself; this is what we are made to do, how we evolved. It is just a bodily function. But 1 Corinthians 6 points out that is not the case at all-it is a very spiritual act with huge consequences. Paul points out that it's not just like eating a meal. "}

{"Question": "How does the woman's nonchalance towards her actions in Proverbs reflect a broader societal behavior regarding deceit and concealment?", "Answer": "This  woman  in  Proverbs  feels  as  little  compunction  about  her  illicit  act  with another  woman's  husband  as  she  does  about  eating  breakfast.  She  wipes  away the trace and goes on with no guilt, saying she's done nothing wrong. While she doesn't feel guilty, she does try to get rid of the evidence. So many people do the exact same thing. They clear an Internet history, erase an e-mail, or pay in cash at the motel so that no one finds out. Your conscience can become so seared that you  no  longer  feel  bad  sneaking  around  in  the  shadows  and  betraying  your spouse. But in fact you need to have a controlled appetite when it comes to sex, where you enjoy  it rightly in marriage, otherwise  you  will  wreck your  life and face the judgment of God. While these four things behaving properly in nature leave no trace, an immoral person's ways are before the eyes of the Lord (5:21). Finally, Agur turns to uncontrolled appetites for status and pride in Proverbs 30:21-23.  These  verses  talk  about  judgment  against  uncontrolled  appetites  for status  that  overturn  the  social  order  and  threaten  the  cosmic  order.  It  is inappropriate  for  a  servant  to  become  a  king  because  he  is  not  ready  to  rule (Longman,  Proverbs,  531).  The  former  slave  had  so  many  things  withheld  from him that when he suddenly has no constraints he will want to consume as much as possible. We observe this in history with rebellions that overthrow tyrannical governments. Often, a tyranny that is on par or worse than the previous tyranny arises in its place. (This is the point of the book  Animal  Farm in its indictment of the communists who overthrew the tsar but set up a system just as oppressive.) A perfect example of this is when Scar becomes the king of Pride Rock in The Lion King. His  appetite  is out  of  control,  so  that  he consumes  without  producing and Pride Rock becomes a wilderness. He wants to be king, but he is not the kind of person who can be king. Pride Rock-like us-needs a king who can control his appetites  so  that  the  world  works  the  way  it  should  (this  is  a  large  point  in Judges). Mufasa-like Solomon with his son in Proverbs-tries to instill this in Simba by telling him that he can't just do anything he wants.

Since  sin  entered  the  world,  men  are  prone  to  be  domineering  or passive.  Adam  stood  by  passively  while  his  wife  was  taken  advantage  of,  and then passed the buck to her when God called him to give an account. Part of the curse  of  sin  is  that  now  husbands  will  want  to  rule  their  wives  in  a  harsh  and domineering way (Gen 3:16).

There  are  a  bunch  of middle-aged boys living in their parents' basement playing video games all day. These contrasting pictures of manhood have been around since the fall in Eden (Gen  3).  Since  sin  entered  the  world,  men  are  prone  to  be  domineering  or passive.  Adam  stood  by  passively  while  his  wife  was  taken  advantage  of,  and then passed the buck to her when God called him to give an account. Part of the curse  of  sin  is  that  now  husbands  will  want  to  rule  their  wives  in  a  harsh  and domineering way (Gen 3:16). That sin nature has been passed down to us, and now it is celebrated in our culture! "}

{"Question": "What are the possible consequences of lacking self-control, particularly in terms of vulnerability to external influences like the devil?", "Answer": "A Real Man Loves Discipline One of the main teachings of Proverbs is that real men know how to control their appetites  for  sex,  money,  power,  status,  food,  and  alcohol.  A  real  man  is  self- controlled!  Proverbs  25:28  says,  \"A  person  who  does  not  control  his  temper  is like a city whose wall is broken down.\" A city like that is vulnerable to any kind of attack (Garrett,  Proverbs, 211). The devil loves to prey on men who are weak like  this.  He  has  destroyed  many  men  through  their  appetites.  In  contrast,  the Spirit of Jesus produces self-control in your life (Gal 5:22-23). "}

Men  are often headstrong. The prideful fool is right in his own eyes and will not listen to what  other  people  have  to  say  (12:15).

The most loving thing we can do is tell them the truth before  they  hurt  themselves  or  others.  We  speak  up  because  the  person  in  sin may  be  a  false  professor  who  has  convinced  himself  he  is  a  believer  when  he might  not  be.  If  he  remains  in  continual,  unrepentant  sin,  he  may  not  be genuinely saved, and we are commanded to confront him before it's too late so that we might gain a brother.

Proverbs  puts  it  this  way:  \"A  person  who  is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that's not his is like one who grabs a dog by the ears\" (26:17). As Longman points out, \"It is obviously stupid to pull the ears of  a  dog.\"  Therefore,  the  verse  \"ridicules  those  who  would  get  involved  in  a fight in which they have no part\" (Proverbs, 469).

Clearly that is not us; only one man in history fits that description-Jesus of Nazareth, the King of glory (Ps 24:7). "}
{"Question": "In what ways did Jesus' sacrifice on the cross contribute to the restoration of the relationship between humanity and God?", "Answer": "Jesus lived the perfect, righteous life that we could never live; then he died the death  we  should  have  died,  and  God  accepted  his  sacrifice  because  he  is  the righteous one (cf. Prov 15:8). Jesus was cut off from God-separated from the Father  for  us.  He  was  the  one  who  cried  out  and  was  unanswered  because  he bore  our  sin  in  his  own  body  on  the  cross  (Matt  27:46;  1  Pet  2:24).  And  it  is through  his  atonement  that  the  relationship  with  God  that  humanity  lost  in  the garden is finally restored.

{"Question": "How do examples from pop culture, such as in Gladiator and Toy Story, illustrate the negative consequences of jealousy?", "Answer": "The  Bible  seems  to  say  the  same  thing  about  envy.

{"Question": "How does the text differentiate between the fate of the wicked who prosper and the righteous who may seem less fortunate in the present?", "Answer": "Envy Is Deadly Because It Will Be Judged by God Several  passages  of  Scripture  warn  us  not  to  envy  sinners  who  prosper,  since God  will  judge  them.  Wisdom  says  not  to  join  them.

It is tempting  to  be  jealous  of  those  who  succeed  despite  their  sinful  behavior.  If  it was  not  tempting,  then  so  many  people  would  not  find  it  appealing.  When ungodly  people  find  themselves  having  all  that  they  want  while  godly  persons have very little, then godliness can seem like it does not benefit much.

{"Question": "How does the interpretation of Proverbs 24:20 as referring to the preservation of the messianic line connect to the concept of the \"lamp\" in biblical symbolism?", "Answer": "Proverbs  24:20,  interpreted  canonically,  may  refer  to  the  preservation  of  the messianic  line  because  the  \"lamp\"  often  refers  to  progeny  (Fox,  Proverbs  10-31, 564).

{"Question": "How did Dr. Bill Cutrer's initial interaction with Jon's dad spark a friendship that extended beyond their first meeting?", "Answer": "D r. Bill Cutrer was one of my dad's best friends, and he was also my mom's ob-gyn.  He  delivered  my  three  brothers  and  me  (  Jon).  In  fact,  when  my mom was pregnant with my twin brother and me, she had to be put on bed rest. My parents stayed at the Cutrers' house during that whole time. He also showed my wife and me an ultrasound of our daughter Maddy before she was born. He was a great friend to our family, and he died a couple years ago from unexpected heart failure. But one of the things I found out at his funeral that I did not know was that when my dad first met Bill, it was at a men's dinner at the church where my  dad  was  the  associate  pastor.  My  dad  just  so  happened  to  sit  at  the  table where Bill was sitting, and they struck up a conversation. Bill was a very funny guy, and he liked to pick at you a little. So the first thing that Bill ever said to my dad-who  was  in  seminary  at  the  time  and  a  little  bit  heavier  than  he  should have  been-was,  \"You  know,  I  noticed  that  Baptist  preachers  love  to  preach against  alcohol  and  smoking,  but  you  never  talk  about  gluttony.

{"Question": "How does the prevalence of jokes about Baptists' love for food tie into the avoidance of discussing gluttony in Fundamentalist Christianity?", "Answer": "When  was  the  last  time  you  heard  a  sermon  on  gluttony?  Fundamentalist Christianity,  especially  in  the  South,  really  loves  to  bash  alcohol  but  does  not want  to  touch  gluttony.  Why?  Well  probably  because  gluttony  hits  a  little  too close to home. After all, it is so well known that Baptists love to eat that people often  make  jokes  about  it.  If  you  asked  somebody  on  the  street,  \"What  are Baptists  known  for?\"  you  would  probably  get  two  responses:  fighting  and potlucks!

Often we are unable to inspect ourselves the way we inspect the world. It is a massive issue, and preachers are guilty of playing into it. A pastor can stand in a pulpit every Sunday and preach hard-really hard-against sin, and everyone says  of  the  pastor  things  like,  \"He  tells  it  like  it  is.\"  \"He  is  a  hellfire  and brimstone preacher.\" \"He's not afraid to call sin, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcsin.'\" And the preacher can get a lot of \"amens\" doing that. And yet, he really is a coward because he does not touch  the  sins  of  his  congregation  but  only  those  of  the  people  outside  his religious  community.  We  can  give  the  impression  that  what  God  really  cares about is homosexuality, drug addictions, and wild partying, but he is not all that concerned about judgmentalism, self-righteousness, and gluttony!

{"Question": "How have the portion sizes and calorie content of fast-food hamburgers evolved from 1957 to the present day?", "Answer": "In  1957  a  fast  food  hamburger  weighed  one  ounce  and  was  210  calories. Today  a  fast  food  hamburger  averages  about  six  ounces  and  618  calories.  In 1957  a  McDonald's  burger,  fries,  and  Coke  totaled  590  calories;  today  a \"supersized\" Quarter Pounder meal notches 1,550 calories. If you eat a Big Mac and  large  fries  and  drink  a  large  Coke,  you  will  have  to  walk  non-stop  for  six hours to burn off the calories. In 1957 a box of movie theater popcorn was three cups and 170 calories; currently it averages sixteen cups and 900 calories. There are more than 160,000 fast-food restaurants in America. Fifty million Americans eat fast food daily, and $110,000,000 is spent on it annually. "}

Gluttony-and we will walk through some  of  this  in  Proverbs-can  be  eating  food  that  is  too  rich  or  costly  (too often), or it can be eating too soon or at inappropriate times.

The food is referred to as deceptive or false  because  it  is  possibly  a  test,  or  at  least  an  opportunity  for  the  ruler  to discern the young man's character.

Contrary  to  what  the \"theologian\" Alan Jackson says, too much of a good thing is a not a good thing. If  you  eat  too  much  you  will  be  uncomfortable,  feeling  like  you  have  a cinderblock in your chest because you are so overstuffed. You might vomit. You certainly run into health risks, as seen above. The key is knowing when to stop and having the control to be able to do it. Everybody is different, so eating \"what you  need\"  is  an  important  clarification.  That  requires  discernment  because  it may be different from what someone else needs. "}

The  law commands  moderation  rather  than  a  lack  of  self-control  when  it  comes  to  our diet, and it does so for our good. The lines of this verse are parallel. Therefore, a wise son keeps the law and does not associate with gluttons, whereas a foolish son  breaks  the  law  and  associates  with  gluttons,  thus  dishonoring  his  family.

{"Question": "How does John Piper distinguish between a legitimate desire and greed in the context of seeking contentment in God?", "Answer": "The problem is complicated by the fact that greed is hard to define.

It's thinking, \"For me to be happy I need God plus _________.\" Once you fill in that blank, you travel the road of greed into  the  world  of  unbelief.  God  is  no  longer  enough.

We can see this destruction all around us. The problem is that we think  we  do  not  really  struggle  with  greed  because  we  do  not  have  a  lot  of money. But the apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Timothy 6 that just to want to be rich and have stuff is deadly (v. 9). You do not have to be rich to crave riches, and a greedy heart shows a life that is walking away from satisfaction in Jesus. And what Paul tells us in the New Testament is echoed throughout the book of Proverbs-greed is deadly. We see this truth clearly in Proverbs 11:24-28. "}

He drove a BMW  at  age  sixteen,  but  when  I  stayed  over  at  his  house  I  noticed  his  mom would  pass  out  drunk  at  night  because  her  husband  never  came  home.  Having riches and possessions does not lead to happiness! "}

{"Question": "How does Proverbs advise individuals to balance their ambition for financial success with other aspects of their lives?", "Answer": "Proverbs tells us to be wise enough to exercise restraint in our pursuit for money.

{"Question": "How did Jesus's refusal to succumb to Satan's temptations ultimately result in him gaining authority over heaven and earth?", "Answer": "Jesus perfectly avoided greed; he was never greedy, even one time. Satan tried to bribe Jesus with the kingdoms of the world if he would bypass the cross and its  suffering,  but  Jesus  perfectly  controlled  his  appetite  and  refused  idolatry. Everything he refused from Satan-and more-was given to him by God later. After all, after his resurrection from the dead he looked at his disciples and said, \"All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth\" (Matt 28:18). Jesus refused the fleeting pleasures of this life so that he could enjoy eternal ones. He knew what we do not seem to understand-our cravings will never be satisfied in this life. Man does not live by bread or flat screen TV alone; he lives by God alone (Matt 4:4). "}

{"Question": "How does the text portray lust as a hidden danger that can ensnare individuals?", "Answer": "Lust is deadly for all of us! Lust is a predator stalking its victim, and we must be able to see it. The problem is that we are often like that deer that does not see the danger until it is too late.

Others of you do not think you have a problem with lust because you do not act on it, but Jesus says it is not just the act of sexual sin that condemns us. It is also the desire for sinful sex that condemns us. That is why Albert Mohler Jr. has said that everyone north of puberty is a sexual sinner.40 Some of you fool yourselves into thinking that you are safe because your fantasies stay in your mind, but the Bible  says  that  sexual  sin  starts  with  lust  in  your  heart  and  mind.  Even  if  you have never acted out in a sinful sexual way, you have thought about it and are therefore guilty of it. "}

Others of you do not think you have a problem with lust because you do not act on it, but Jesus says it is not just the act of sexual sin that condemns us. It is also the desire for sinful sex that condemns us. That is why Albert Mohler Jr. has said that everyone north of puberty is a sexual sinner.40 Some of you fool yourselves into thinking that you are safe because your fantasies stay in your mind, but the Bible  says  that  sexual  sin  starts  with  lust  in  your  heart  and  mind.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 30:20 illustrate the tendency to rationalize or justify immoral actions, specifically in the context of adultery?", "Answer": "Proverbs  30:20  says  of  the  adulteress,  \"This  is  the  way  of  an  adulteress:  she eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcI've done nothing wrong.'\" What this verse means  is  that  we  find  a  way  to  justify  our  sexual  sin.

God  says  that's  destructive,  and  we  can observe that in the pain that many experience as a result of premarital sex or in the higher divorce rate among those who live together before marriage. Still, we choose to ignore the evidence. Or the world says to get what you want now and pay  for  it  later.  Spend  money  you  don't  have!  But  God  says  that  is  foolish.

{"Question": "How does God's wisdom, as outlined in the text, contrast with the principles of worldly wisdom regarding generosity and wealth?", "Answer": "God's wisdom clashes with the wisdom of the world. Worldly wisdom says, \"If you want to be rich, you need to be stingy and keep things for yourself.\" But godly wisdom says, \"One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor\" (11:24). Worldly wisdom says, \"If someone wrongs  you,  get  back  at  them,  hold  a  grudge,  or  revel  in  their  failures.\"  But godly wisdom says, \"Don't gloat when your enemy falls\" (24:17) and, \"If your enemy  is  hungry,  give  him  food  to  eat\"  (25:21).  Do  good  to  your  enemy! Worldly  wisdom  says,  \"Money  will  make  you  happy,  so  get  as  much  as  you can.\"  But  godly  wisdom  says,  \"Anyone  trusting  in  his  riches  will  fall\"  (11:28) and, \"A righteous person eats until he is satisfied\" (13:25). Be content with what you  have!  God  says  that  often  you  will  be  happier  with  less:  \"Better  is  a  little with  the  fear  of  the  LORD  than  great  treasure  with  turmoil\"  (15:16).  While  the world calls us to chase money with all we have, we can observe that riches often bring great sadness.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs warn about the deceptive nature of relying solely on one's own judgment without seeking counsel?", "Answer": "\"There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death\" (14:12; 16:25). What seems like the right course to you actually will lead you to ruin and death because you are not seeing things clearly. Left to ourselves, we will  pridefully  choose  the  wrong  way.  Proverbs  says,  \"Foolishness  is  bound  to the heart of a youth\" (22:15). Anyone who has children knows that this is true. A parent does not have to teach their kids to be stingy with their toys, but they do have  to  teach  them  to  share.  Wise  choices-like  sharing-do  not  come  to  us naturally.  That is  true for  children, but  it  is also  true for  adults.  We  are just  as self-deceived.  As  Proverbs  says,  \"A  fool's  way  is  right  in  his  own  eyes,  but whoever  listens  to  counsel  is  wise\"  (12:15).

{"Question": "What parallels can be drawn between the natural inclination towards self-centeredness in youth and the challenges adults face in making wise choices?", "Answer": "\"There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death\" (14:12; 16:25). What seems like the right course to you actually will lead you to ruin and death because you are not seeing things clearly. Left to ourselves, we will  pridefully  choose  the  wrong  way.

{"Question": "Who does Agur credit with possessing wisdom in Proverbs 30:1-6, and how does this belief shape his perspective on seeking wisdom?", "Answer": "In  Proverbs  30:1-6  Agur  acknowledges  that  he  is  not  wise-since  wisdom starts  with  recognizing  your  own  ignorance-and  that  wisdom  lies  in  heaven with God. No one has gone up to him to get wisdom. Wisdom belongs to him, and it belongs to his Son (30:4; Jesus!).

If you do not recognize this, the consequences will be ruinous. Pridefully refusing to listen to counsel harms you and the people around you. You will go astray, and you just might lead others astray as well by your foolishness (see 10:17). "}

{"Question": "How do various responses to insults, as highlighted in the text, contrast with the approach advocated in Proverbs?", "Answer": "Proverbs  mentions  all  kinds  of  ways  people  try  to  get  even  that  do  not necessarily  include  violence.  Some  respond  to  an  insult  from  someone  else  by crafting  a  great  comeback.  Some  lash  out  by  gossiping  about  others.  For example,  in  one  of  Taylor  Swift's  songs  where  she  is  done  wrong  by  a boyfriend, she tells him that she will tell everyone else that he is gay. Proverbs calls  us  to  another  path.  Proverbs  17:9  says,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense promotes love, but whoever gossips about it separates friends.\" People try to get even  by  constantly  bringing  up  past  wrongs  done  to  them  and  refusing  to  let them  go.  Some  just  blow  up  in  a  fury  and  lose  their  temper  with  their  wife, husband,  or  children  by  saying  things  they  should  not  say  and  do  not  really mean.  It  damages  their  relationships  and  ability  to  share  intimacy.  Instead, Proverbs 17:27 urges, \"The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding.\" So instead of gossiping or losing our temper or making lists of wrongs done to us, we are called to be cool- headed and let go of offenses done to us!

For example,  in  one  of  Taylor  Swift's  songs  where  she  is  done  wrong  by  a boyfriend, she tells him that she will tell everyone else that he is gay. Proverbs calls  us  to  another  path.  Proverbs  17:9  says,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense promotes love, but whoever gossips about it separates friends.\" People try to get even  by  constantly  bringing  up  past  wrongs  done  to  them  and  refusing  to  let them  go.  Some  just  blow  up  in  a  fury  and  lose  their  temper  with  their  wife, husband,  or  children  by  saying  things  they  should  not  say  and  do  not  really mean.  It  damages  their  relationships  and  ability  to  share  intimacy.  Instead, Proverbs 17:27 urges, \"The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding.\" So instead of gossiping or losing our temper or making lists of wrongs done to us, we are called to be cool- headed and let go of offenses done to us!

He carried his cross, got punched in the face, and  was  whipped,  stripped  naked,  and  mocked  by  taunts:  \"If  you  are  really God's  Son,  come  down  off  that  cross!\"  And  when  he  went  through  that,  Jesus looked  into  the  faces  of  his  murderers  and  mockers  and  said,  \"Father,  forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing\" (Luke 23:34). We might be  tempted  to  think  Jesus  was  wimpy  in  that  moment  and  is  calling  us  to  be wimpy  like  he  is,  but  that  would  be  wrong.  Jesus  is  no  wimp.  He  trusted  the justice of God! It takes more toughness not to retaliate and to wait for judgment day!  Proverbs  24  says  that  if  we  fail  to  trust  in  God's  wrath  for  the  day  of judgment, we will experience that wrath ourselves on judgment day! So, again, what is the antidote to wrath? "}

{"Question": "What is the consequence of holding a grudge according to the text?", "Answer": "The  bottom  line  is  that  if  we  are  wrathful  people  it  is  because  we  do  not believe the gospel. There are two possibilities for the people who have wronged us  (Piper,  \"Future  Grace,  Part  4\").  First,  if  it  is  a  Christian  who  hurt  us,  Jesus drowned in his own blood to pay for the sin he or she committed against us. God has not swept what that person did to us under the rug of the universe. He has dealt with it. He took what that person did so seriously that he killed his Son for it.
