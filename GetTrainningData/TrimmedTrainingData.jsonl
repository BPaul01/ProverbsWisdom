{"Question": "Can you recall a time when you struggled to follow through on something you knew you should do?", "Answer": "However,  the  problem  doesn't  stop  there.  The  problem  is  that  even  if  we  do look to the Book, and even if we do somehow pull out some tips for how to live a  better  life,  more  often  than  not  we  don't  follow  what  we  already  know. Oftentimes we know what to do, but we can't bring ourselves to do it. Think of how often we mess up. Think of the hurtful words you've said to a friend or your spouse  or  your  parents.  Think  of  the  times  you've  said  more  than  you  should say. Think of the times you spoke too quickly and couldn't get your words back. Think  about  the  time  someone  confronted  you  with  something  you  needed  to hear, and in anger you blew them off with, \"Who do you think you are?!\" Think about  the  times  you  should've  lovingly  confronted  someone  and  didn't.  Think about that person whose feelings you hurt. Think about that lie you desperately hope your parents won't find out or your boyfriend won't find out or your wife won't  find  out.  Think  about  those  things  you  keep  hidden  from  your  parents. Think  about  that  time  you  screamed,  \"I  hate  you!\"  to  your  mom.  Think  about that secret that you just couldn't keep to yourself, and in a moment of supposed confidential privacy you whispered in someone's ear, \"Well, did you hear what happened  to  .  .  .  ?\"  Think  about  the  times  you've  bragged  about  yourself  so others  would  think  you're  something.  Think  about  the  mistakes  you've  made with your children. Think about the times you didn't discipline a behavior that has  now  gotten  out  of  hand.  Think  about  the  times  your  children  saw  you  do something  you  had  told  them  not  to  do  or  heard  you  say  something  you  told them  not  to  say.  Think  about  that  grudge  you've  held  and  refused  to  let  go because someone really hurt you. Think about the times you've been stingy with your  money  instead  of  generous  to  a  person  with  a  real  need.  Think  about  the frivolous  spending  that  got  you  in  trouble.  Think  about  the  get-rich-quick scheme  that  ruined  you.  Think  about  the  times  you  didn't  finish  your  job assignment on time because you got sidetracked by Facebook. Think about the people  you're  jealous  of  because  they  got  the  promotion  that  passed  you  by. Think  about  the  times  you've  nagged  or  ignored  helping  your  spouse.  Think about  how  you  repeat  the  same  stupid  mistake  over  and  over  and  don't  learn from it. On and on and on we could go. "}
{"Question": "What is highlighted as the crucial need for individuals in the text?", "Answer": "What does all of this tell us? It tells us that we have a major problem that no amount of tips will solve. It tells us that we are not wise and are often foolish. It tells  us  that  we  are  broken  and  don't  work  right.  It  tells  us  that  we  are  in desperate need of wisdom to make decisions and navigate our way through life. But  we  can't  just  say  that  we  need  wisdom  and  then  go  after  it.  Since  we  are broken,  we  don't  even  follow  the  wisdom  we  already  know.  We  do  things  we know are hurtful and foolish. We just can't help ourselves. "}
{"Question": "How does sin create barriers between individuals and various aspects of their surroundings?", "Answer": "Because  of  sin,  there  are  barriers  now  between  us  and  God,  between  us  and others, and between us and the world around us. We no longer rightly perceive the  way  the  world  works-we  no  longer  recognize  the  order-so  we  can't navigate  through  daily  life.  God  created  the  world  with  an  order  to  work  in  a certain  way,  and  we  must  live  according  to  that  to  be  truly  wise;  but  in  our brokenness we don't see it. "}
{"Question": "Who are the primary authors of the book of Proverbs, and why is Solomon considered the main author?", "Answer": "These  are  the  proverbs  \"of  Solomon\"  (v.  1).

There  are other  authors  like  Agur  and  King  Lemuel,  but  it  should  be  no  shock  that Solomon  is  the  main  author.

{"Question": "Which textual elements does Solomon employ to elucidate the comprehensive nature of wisdom?", "Answer": "So  Solomon's  purpose  is  to  give  wisdom  in  order  to  bring  harmony  to  the kingdom. Proverbs 1:2 clearly states the purpose of the book-to impart wisdom to the reader. But what is wisdom besides the necessary means to rule? Solomon uses several words to help us grasp all that wisdom entails. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 1:2 define wisdom in relation to understanding and correction?", "Answer": "Wisdom Is Correction and Understanding (1:2) Proverbs 1:2 says the purpose of the book is to know \"wisdom and discipline,\" or  \"understanding  and  correction.\"  Wisdom  is  the  kind  of  knowledge  that  helps you  know  what  is  going  on  around  you.  Are  you  able  to  read  situations  and people  correctly?  If  not,  you  need  discipline.1  This  requires  the  humility  to recognize that you don't know everything and to receive counsel from another. How do you respond to correction, to teaching, to counsel? That has a lot to do with whether or not you are wise. The know-it-all is not as wise as he thinks; the Bible says he's a fool. "}

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 1:3 define foolishness in relation to the ability to discern good and evil?", "Answer": "The problem for us is that even in the church we so often think of foolishness and wisdom as morally neutral. Pastors will even say things like being wise or foolish is not about right and wrong so much as best and not best. So foolishness is when I break my hand by slamming it on the floor because Tony Romo threw another interception to cost the Cowboys a playoff spot. That's not necessarily a sin;  it's  just  stupid,  a  pastor  will  say.  No!  That's  not  what  the  Bible  means  by wisdom and foolishness according to Proverbs 1:3. Foolishness lacks the ability to discern good and evil. It is a sin to be a fool. If I were to ask most people who on  the  sitcom  The  Simpsons  is  a  fool,  almost  everyone  who  has  ever  watched  it would say Bart because he does dumb things that get him in trouble. If I were to ask who is wise on The Simpsons, many would say Lisa because she has her head on straight. According to Proverbs, Lisa is just as foolish as Bart because she treats her parents like idiots. Folly is sinfulness and wisdom is righteousness according to Proverbs. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs define wisdom as shrewdness and discretion in making decisions?", "Answer": "Wisdom Is Discernment (1:4) Proverbs  1:4  says  that  wisdom  is  shrewdness  and  discretion.  Wisdom  is  the ability  to  read  a  situation  and  make  the  right  decision.  That's  the  point  of  the book.  Solomon  wants  to  give  this  discernment  to  the  inexperienced  and  the youth.  As  we  will  see,  Proverbs  gives  categories  of  people  (inexperienced, mocking,  foolish,  wise,  etc.).  Inexperienced  people  are  not  wise  or  foolish  yet; instead,  they  are  open  to  instruction  in  wisdom  or  folly.  They  are  gullible  and usually believe the most recent thing they have heard. They are easily enticed or persuaded (see the discussion in Longman, Proverbs, 96-97). This is the audience that  Solomon  is  going  after  because  there  is  still  hope.  Inexperience  and youthfulness often go hand in hand, and that is why Solomon is so concerned (as is  Moses  in  Deut  6)  with  parents  teaching  their  children  right  and  wrong. Proverbs tells those of us who are parents (and grandparents) that it is our task to instruct  our  children  in  wisdom.  Those  who  are  young  and  those  who  are inexperienced need to acquire the ability to perceive what's going on, make the right decisions, and avoid the bad ones. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon challenge the misconception that wisdom equates to no longer needing to learn?", "Answer": "Wisdom Is Obtaining Guidance (1:5-6) Solomon says  that  a  wise  man  will  listen and  increase  in  learning;  a  wise man will  acquire  direction  and  guidance.  This  is  interesting.  The  audience  that Solomon refers to in this verse is \"a wise person.\" He says that the wise need to grow in learning and get direction. Huh? Doesn't being wise mean that you've arrived at the place where you don't need to learn anymore? Solomon says that's a foolish outlook on life. The truly wise will have the humility to know that they still need to listen to counsel instead of having the arrogance to think they have arrived.  The  wise  recognize  that  no  one  graduates.  We  all  need  to  hear  the wisdom of Proverbs again and again throughout our lives. Wisdom is not a goal to attain; it's a pursuit that you spend your whole life on. "}
{"Question": "What does Solomon suggest is the difference between arrogance and humility in relation to wisdom?", "Answer": "Wisdom Is Obtaining Guidance (1:5-6) Solomon says  that  a  wise  man  will  listen and  increase  in  learning;  a  wise man will  acquire  direction  and  guidance.

{"Question": "What are the key components of wisdom as outlined by Solomon in the preamble of the book?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  the  point  of  the  book  is  to  help  you  understand  these  wise sayings so you can be wise and make wise decisions in your daily life. He's laid out  in  this  preamble  the  multifaceted  nature  of  wisdom.  Wisdom  is  being corrected and disciplined. Wisdom understands and reads situations. Wisdom is godly  morality.  Wisdom  is  justice.  Wisdom  is  discretion  and  discernment  of right  and  wrong,  stupid  and  smart,  what  path  to  take  and  which  one  to  avoid.

{"Question": "What role does trust in God play in the process of acquiring wisdom as portrayed in the text?", "Answer": "You Get Wisdom by Reverent Trust in the Lord (1:7) How  can  we  be  wise  like  this?  How  can  we  learn  to  read  situations  and  make wise  decisions?  How  do  you  get  this  multifaceted  wisdom?  As  we  will  see throughout the book, Solomon says that all wisdom is \"religious\" or spiritual in nature  because  it's  only  through  a  relationship  with  the  Lord  that  one  can  be wise.  The  fear  of-the  reverence  for-Yahweh  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and discipline, but the wise person is the one who fears, trusts, and reverences Yahweh. This is the first step and the essential component in gaining wisdom-the fear of the Lord. Proverbs is quite clear that the way to get  wisdom  is  to  depend  on  God  rather  than  on  yourself  (cf.  3:5-6).  The everyday, nitty-gritty details of your life are to be lived in fear of God. There is no  sacred  and  secular  divide  in  your  life.  We  so  often  think  that  \"going  to church\" and mission efforts and quiet times are the godly things we do in life. Other things like our work, our kids' soccer teams, or how we spend our money are the secular or neutral parts of our lives. Solomon crushes that. The everyday decisions  that  we  make  are  to  be  done  in  fear  of  the  Lord,  and  the  everyday decisions  we  make  reveal  whether  or  not  we  fear  the  Lord.  God  is  concerned with your whole life. The everyday decisions we make are indicators of whether we fear him or not. How you eat dinner, how you finish tasks assigned to you, how you spend money, how you parent your kids, and how you respond to your parents  are  all  before  the  Lord.  Every  nook  and  cranny  of  your  life  is  to  be governed by God. "}
{"Question": "What analogy does Jon use to illustrate the distortion in our perception due to sin?", "Answer": "We all view the world in a certain way-through a certain lens. However, the fall of humankind into sin has assured that we do not see the world rightly. As an analogy, I ( Jon) am colorblind. I can't tell the difference between red and green and a whole host of other colors. I don't see the world the way it actually is. As a result,  I  make  poor  decisions  with  regard  to  fashion.  In  a  very  real  way,  that's what is true of all of us in our sin. We don't view the world the way it really is, so we make wrong decisions that go against the grain of how the world really is. However,  if  we  will  observe  the  world  through  the  lens  that  God  has  given  in fear  of  him,  we  can  start  perceiving  how  things  really  are.  And  once  we  start living according to that pattern, we will walk in wisdom. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does the Bible emphasize the importance of asking for wisdom as a means to receive it?", "Answer": "The only way to be wise is to trust in the Lord and be in a relationship with him.  Wisdom  comes  from  Yahweh  (2:6),  so  we  are  taught  in  the  Bible  to  ask him  for  it  (e.g.,  Jas  1).  According  to  Proverbs,  this  wisdom  is  filtered  through receiving  instruction  from  a  human  mediator  like  a  sage  or  a  parent.  In  our context that might mean a parent, a godly and wise friend, a Bible teacher, or a pastor. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does the Spirit's influence shape the individual's approach to counsel and strength?", "Answer": "The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him-a Spirit of wisdom and understanding, a Spirit of counsel and strength, a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD.

{"Question": "Who does the text identify as the personification of Wisdom and how is this figure characterized?", "Answer": "What if wisdom wasn't a concept or an idea or a set of ideas you had to learn at  all?  What  if  Wisdom  was  a  person  you  could  know  and  have  a  relationship with? What if Wisdom was a person you could love and walk with, and just by knowing, loving, and walking with this person it would actually make you wise? 2 What if Wisdom was a person who spoke to you, and by listening to Wisdom's voice you could actually grow in wisdom? Proverbs will teach us that Wisdom isn't an Israelite Dear Abby3; it's not a bunch of tips you learn to live out. Wisdom is  a  person-Jesus  of  Nazareth.  Through  a  relationship  with  him  you  can  be reconciled  to  God,  to  others,  and  to  the  world  around  you.  Through  a relationship with him, he will begin to produce in you the wisdom he lives out- the wisdom of Proverbs! "}

{"Question": "In what way do the scholars view proverbs as promises rather than just rules?", "Answer": "Some cheat and never face the consequences in this life, and others are honest and  lose  everything.  So  how  are  we  to  understand  this  passage  now?  Is  this proverb true? Is its warning a promise? Some scholars solve this tension-their observation of cases to the contrary-by saying that the proverbs are just rules that are generally true but not always true. So they say these are not promises, just how things work out most times. That's not the whole story. The proverbs are promises. The proverbs will always come true. You can bank on them. We need to understand this about the proverbs. Proverbs are promises that generally come  true  now  but  always  come  true  later.  They  are  generally  true  in  this  life, but they are absolutely true in the life to come. Eventually these will come true even if they don't come true immediately.5 Again, wisdom is an order by which God made the world and behind which he stands to make sure that it happens. We see this in God's Word. Achan's greed was found out pretty quickly, and it cost him and his family their lives ( Josh 7). Ahab and Jezebel's greedy murder of Naboth to take possession of his vineyard didn't cost them their lives for years after their sin, but it did cost them their lives eventually (1 Kgs 22; 2 Kgs 9).

{"Question": "What does James suggest is at the root of conflicts and disputes among individuals?", "Answer": "What is the source of wars and fights among you? Don't they come from your passions that wage war within you? You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and wage war.

{"Question": "What is the impact of pursuing the \"American Dream\" according to the sage's perspective?", "Answer": "Solomon warns his son not to follow this path, but our problem is that we all fall into it. The \"American Dream\" is a nightmare according to the sage. It will destroy you. In high school I often used to sleep over at a friend's house, and we would sneak up to the pantry after midnight to get a snack. We loved to stay at his house because his dad was a very rich businessman, which meant they had a big house and awesome snacks. Many nights, while sneaking into the pantry, we would find his mom passed out on the rug in front of their TV. She would drink herself to sleep because her husband was so busy making money he rarely came home. He was never at his son's ball games. His drive to succeed absolutely tore his family apart. The sad part is he didn't see it coming because he thought all that  money  and  success  was  enough  to  make  them  happy,  and  instead  it  made them miserable. "}
{"Question": "What warning does the text convey about the deceptive nature of falling into destructive desires?", "Answer": "Solomon says that we will reap what we have sown. Our greed may cause us to lose a job, our reputation, or our family in this life; and it will certainly lead to judgment when we stand before God. Eventually it will be exposed. Eventually you will fall into the trap if you don't walk in the way of wisdom. First Timothy 6:9  says,  \"Those  who  want  to  be  rich  fall  into  temptation,  a  trap,  and  many foolish  and  harmful  desires,  which  plunge  people  into  ruin  and  destruction.\" We've  got  a  big  problem:  we  are  headed  for  a  trap,  and  we  can't  see  it  in ourselves  as  easily  as  we  see  it  in  others.  Of  course  this  isn't  a  good  path.  Of course  it  destroys  families.  We  can  look  at  the  miserable  lives  of  the  rich  and famous and see that. And yet we never see it in ourselves until it's too late! But there is good news . . . "}
{"Question": "Can you explain why Solomon chooses to depict wisdom as a woman in his teachings?", "Answer": "This  may  raise  an  objection  in  your  mind:  \"Pastor,  you  said  that  Jesus  is Wisdom, but Solomon says Wisdom is a woman.\" Why does Solomon present a woman here? First, Solomon is symbolically talking about his wise teaching. He uses the poetic device of personification to get the reader's attention. Second, the Hebrew noun for wisdom is a feminine noun, so the personification will take on feminine  characteristics  (again  this  is  poetry;  it's  not  saying  that  Jesus  is  a woman). Hebrew, like Spanish and French, has gender identities for its nouns; so when there is a metaphor, it takes on that identity (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15, 83).  Third,  Solomon  knows  that  his  son-a  young  man-will  be  drawn  to  an attractive woman. In order to get his son to listen to his teaching, he personifies it as a beautiful woman whom he wants his son to marry. This might have helped me ( Jon) in high school. I hate biology. I almost failed the subject. It was boring to me, and I didn't understand it. But if my teacher had presented biology to me as Ashley-the beautiful, smart, funny, complex woman that I married and seek to learn about on a daily basis-then I would have been all ears! That's exactly what  Solomon  is  doing  here.  He  is  telling  his  son  that  learning  the  wisdom  of Proverbs  is  as  scintillating,  exhilarating,  enjoyable,  and  satisfying  as  pursuing and marrying a knockout woman! "}

{"Question": "How does the reception of Jesus's Spirit relate to the act of repentance as described in the text?", "Answer": "If you do repent, Wisdom promises two things to you. First, you will receive Jesus's Spirit. Turning to Wisdom will lead to receiving the spirit of wisdom (v. 23). There is much going on here. The Spirit of God hovered over the waters at creation to make the world.

The  tabernacle  and  the  temple  were  patterned  after  the  garden  of Eden, so they were in a real sense a rebuilding of creation or a \"new creation.\" The Spirit of wisdom is also given to Messiah since he will ultimately make all things  new  (Isa  11).  Since  the  Spirit  built  creation  according  to  the  pattern  of wisdom and harmony, having the Spirit is essential to walking according to that pattern. The Spirit is given to you to transform you and to empower you to walk in  wisdom,  but  you  must  repent  to  receive  the  Spirit.  When  you  do,  the  Lord promises in Ezekiel 36:27, \"I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes.\" "}

{"Question": "How does the depiction of Wisdom's response to calamity serve as a reminder of divine judgment?", "Answer": "Wisdom  recounts  a  past  record  of  refusing  the  invitation  (i.e.,  the  teachings  of Wisdom).

So Wisdom will  laugh  at  your  calamity  and  terror  and  distress  when  it  comes  like  a  storm (this language is reminiscent of the wisdom conclusion to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount).  Wisdom  here  is  clearly  linked  to  the  Lord  and  the  judgment  he  pours out.  The  Lord  is  the  one  who  ridicules  and  laughs  at  the  wicked  (Ps  2).  The judgment of the Lord is a storm (Ps 83:15). This passage reminds us of a modern parable:  hell  hath  no  fury  like  a  woman  scorned.  Those  who  scorn  Woman Wisdom will encounter fury. "}

The questions  we  must  ask  are,  Whose  voice  will  I  listen  to?  What  message  will  I trust as good and helpful? What message will I reject as bad and harmful? "}
{"Question": "As highlighted in the text, what distinguishes wisdom from merely possessing a high IQ?", "Answer": "Proverbs 2:6-9 clearly states that the Lord gives wisdom as a gift to his faithful covenant  people,  and  he  thereby  guards  them  from  the  temptations  that  might destroy them (we will see this later). Commit to the Lord's wisdom, and you will understand  righteousness  and  the  good  path  (v.  9).  We  see  in  Proverbs  2  the same words used to describe multifaceted wisdom in 1:1-7. So pursuing wisdom and receiving it from the Lord will give you what the introduction to Proverbs promised. Again, wisdom is not a high IQ; it's moral discernment of good and evil.  It  is  the  ability  to  see  life  from  God's  perspective  and  then  to  act accordingly. "}
{"Question": "What dual threats are outlined in verses 12-22 that pose risks to one's well-being and life?", "Answer": "Wisdom  will  save  you  from  the  path  of  evil  that  leads  to  death.  There  are  two groups mentioned in verses 12-22-two sets of voices that can pull you toward ruin and death: (1) evil men and (2) an evil woman. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs identify perverse speech as condoning sin and rejoicing in evil actions?", "Answer": "Perverse  speech  calls  sin  \"good\"  and  rejoices  in  evil.  Proverbs  24:24  states, \"Whoever  says  to  the  guilty,  â€˜You  are  innocent'-peoples  will  curse  him,  and nations will denounce him.\" Justifying someone's sin or saying that it's not a sin is  perverse  speech.  For  example,  it  is  perverse  speech  to  tell  someone  their grudge is warranted because the hurt perpetrated against them was very severe. It  is  not  right  in  the  eyes  of  God.  Proverbs  30:20  says,  \"This  is  the  way  of  an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, â€˜I've done nothing wrong.'\" People can find all kinds of ways to justify their sin as if it's not wrong. \"It's OK for me to flirt with this woman at work because my wife doesn't respond to me the  way  that  she  should.\"  With  our  mouths  we  justify  and  rationalize  and minimize our sin or the sins of others. Any person who will counsel you in such a way as to justify sin in your life is someone of perverse speech that should be avoided. They are leading you down dark paths, and they rejoice in evil (2:13- 14). "}

{"Question": "How does Solomon link the male need for respect and admiration to their susceptibility to flattery?", "Answer": "How  does  this  woman  work?  She  flatters  with  her  words.  This  is  perhaps shocking to some. Most of us think of unfaithfulness as starting with looks, but that's not the case in Proverbs. Adultery and sexual sin start with flattery. One of the top needs that men have is respect and admiration; so if a woman inflates the male ego, he will usually respond. They are suckers for flattery. This may start in a subtle way that  the man doesn't recognize as unwise. His coworker might lend  a  sympathetic  ear,  or  she  may  laugh  at  his  jokes.  He  may  think  of  their conversations  as  just  \"harmless  flirting.\"  Or  perhaps  he  justifies  his  flirtation with, \"I'm not happy at home.\" Before long, he starts to look forward to work events  that  she  will  be  at,  or  he  begins  to  send  secret  messages  to  her  on Facebook. Before he knows it he's cheating on his wife, and it all started with what  many  looking  on  would  justify  as  \"harmless  conversation.\"  This  can happen with women too. Solomon is teaching his son, but if he was teaching his daughter he could warn about forbidden men that flatter with their words to get women to do what they want! "}
{"Question": "What paths does the text suggest will lead individuals to protection from derailment?", "Answer": "So  listen  to  the  father  and  get  wisdom  so  that  you  can  walk  righteous  paths that  protect  you  from  derailing.  The  upright-those  who  are  connected  to  the Lord through Wisdom ( Jesus)-will inhabit the land (i.e., Israel in that context and the new creation for us in Christ). This is a reference to the eternal life with God in the homeland he provides for us. But the wicked-those following after Folly as evidenced by their distorted worldview and sexual sin-will experience the  \"death\"  of  exile  (i.e.,  Israel's  exile  in  that  context,  and  ultimately  hell  for those outside of Christ).

{"Question": "How does the concept of Jesus embodying Wisdom intertwine with his role as the obedient Son?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus is not only the Wisdom of Proverbs, but he is also the Son who perfectly listens  to  his  Father,  perfectly  keeps  the  covenant,  and  avoids  immorality. However,  in  the  end,  Jesus  takes  the  penalty  that  covenant-breakers  like  us deserve. He went down into death for sexual sinners like us, but three days later he  triumphantly  returned  to  the  paths  of  life!  Through  his  life,  death,  and resurrection he has defeated all of our enemies. It is not inevitable that they will drag  you  down  to  death.  He  can  rescue  you  from  them  by  empowering  you  to walk  in  wisdom.  It  is  not  inevitable  that  they  will  cause  your  exile  from  God forever. Jesus came out of death to inherit the whole earth, and you can be his coheir  if  you  are  united  to  him  by  faith.  If  you  find  yourself  giving  in  to  evil, consistently  rationalizing  your  sin,  or  being  enslaved  to  sexual  sin,  then circumstances may be revealing to you that you're not listening to the voice of Wisdom. You have, instead, been seduced by the voice of another. If that's true, come  to  Jesus-the  Wisdom  of  God-and  follow  his  leading  voice!  Listen  to him. He has the words that lead to life. "}
{"Question": "What role does motivation play in the process of instilling wisdom, as per Solomon's understanding?", "Answer": "I n high school I ( Jon) lettered in two sports and competed all year round, so I was  in  great  shape.  But  once  I  graduated  and  ceased  to  play  competitive sports, I no longer had any motivation to work out and stay in shape. The results were not good!

{"Question": "What is identified as the primary cause of foolishness, according to the given text?", "Answer": "Here's the key: don't be wise in your own eyes. That's the root of foolishness going all the way back to the garden of Eden. Instead, you should fear Yahweh. Thinking  that  you  are  wise  is  foolishness.  Wisdom  and  folly  boil  down  to humility  and  pride.  Submit  every  area  of  your  life  to  the  Lord,  and  he  will produce  wisdom  in  you.

{"Question": "Can you speculate on the potential implications of the reciprocal pattern proposed in the text?", "Answer": "So obey God by doing the odd verses and in return you will get the rewards of the even verses. But this raises an important question: Is this really true? What about instances where things don't work this way? "}
{"Question": "What is the ultimate goal of God's actions towards individuals, as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "Why  does  he  do  this?  Because  he  loves  us  just  like  parents  who  discipline their child out of love. He loves you enough to allow hardship at times to prepare you for something greater later. He loves us and wants to make us like Jesus, so that means discipline (cf. Heb 12-he allows suffering to produce holiness). So yes, God will reward us, but he doesn't always give us what we want when we want  it.  Instead,  he  gives  us  exactly  what  we  need  when  we  need  it.  He  will conform you to the image of his covenant-keeping Son so that you are the kind of  person  who  can  rightly  experience  the  covenant  blessings.  Sometimes  you will  suffer  now  and  not  receive  an  immediate  reward  because  the  Lord  is molding you for a greater glory later. "}
{"Question": "What role does wisdom play in highlighting Jesus as the ultimate keeper of the covenant?", "Answer": "Jesus Kept the Covenant for You The false gospel of the prosperity preachers misunderstands that none of us are faithful covenant-keeping sons. None of us have been perfectly obedient to the Lord.  None  of  us  have  perfectly  trusted  God  instead  of  ourselves.  None  of  us have  perfectly  turned  from  evil  or  been  completely  generous  as  we  should  be. This covenant relationship between the Father and the Son is not kept by God's firstborn son Israel, nor is it kept by David, Solomon, or Solomon's sons. Jesus is the Son who finally keeps it. Luke 2:52 shows that he is the Son of Solomon who grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and people (cf. Prov 3:4)  (Goldsworthy,  Tree  of  Life,  57-58).  He  is  the  King  with  the  covenant  on  his heart (3:3; cf. 20:28). So he is the one who gets the blessing, not us. "}
{"Question": "How does the mentioned individual's righteousness impact those who have faith in him?", "Answer": "The  good  news  is  that  he  represents  us  before  the  Father  in  this  covenant relationship. He lived up to our obligations for us, and then he took the curses of covenant breaking in our place. He experienced sickness, sorrows, enemies, and a  premature  death  for  us  (see  Isa  52:13-53:12).  He  offers  full  pardon  to  all covenant-breakers  who  believe  in  him.  His  righteous  record  of  keeping  the covenant is credited to the account of all who are united to him by faith, and as a result  they  will  experience  the  blessings  of  covenant  faithfulness  by  his  merits not their own! And if you are joined to him by faith, God will do the work by the power of the Spirit to conform you into the image of his covenant-keeping Son -sometimes through discipline. "}

{"Question": "How do commercials play a role in prompting individuals to acknowledge their deepest desires?", "Answer": "What about you? What one thing do you want most? What in life do you have to  have?  Often  commercials  can  awaken  us  to  our  desires.  Maybe  there  are things you just have to possess, foods you just have to consume, or relationships you just have to have. What's the superior treasure in your life that you wake up thinking about, go to sleep dreaming about, and spend your day planning to get? It may be money, stuff, sex, success, or any number of things. "}
{"Question": "What does the personification of wisdom as a beautiful woman signify in the context of the text?", "Answer": "Proverbs 3:13-18 is a poem or a hymn about the supreme value of wisdom. As we've seen, Solomon has personified his wisdom as a beautiful woman. He says to get her above anything else. Again, in the fullness of time (Gal 4:4), the New Testament revealed to us that this personification pointed to a real person-Jesus of  Nazareth-whom  we  can  know  and  pursue  and  treasure  above  all  else.  The benefits of wisdom are given here to motivate us to be with her at any cost. The idea is to get wisdom because it leads to a happy and blessed life. We see that this idea brackets the poem (\"happy\" in vv. 13 and 18). This is called an inclusio (Garrett,  Proverbs,  257).  Garrett  points  out  that  this  passage  is  a  hymn  and  is bracketed  by  \"blessing\"  at  the  beginning  and  end.  Solomon  gives  a  beatitude: Blessed or happy will be the one who gets Wisdom-Jesus. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon emphasize the benefits of prioritizing wisdom in Proverbs 3:16-17?", "Answer": "So  Solomon  tells  us  in  Proverbs  3:16-17  that  getting  wisdom  above  all  else will add long life, riches, a good reputation, and a pleasant course of life. Wow! You get to live longer because the wise and pleasant paths you are walking help you avoid the pitfalls that lead to an early death, and you receive honor because those paths help you avoid things that will damage your reputation. Living a life of risky and foolish behavior as laid out in this book-whether it be sexual sin, violent behavior, or not being able to control your tongue-may lead to an early death or at least a ruined reputation. On the other hand, heeding the wisdom of this  book  will  lead  to  wealth  since  hard  work  instead  of  laziness,  spending wisely  rather  than  frivolously,  and  saving  for  down  times  will  ensure  that  you have  the  provision  you  need.  Again,  following  the  wisdom  of  this  book  will generally lead to these blessings right now, but they will always ultimately lead to  these  blessings.  Proverbs  are  promises  that  are  generally  true  now,  but  they are always ultimately true. "}
{"Question": "How does possessing wisdom enable individuals to perceive and align with the order of the world?", "Answer": "This  is  why  wisdom  is  so  valuable.  There  is  a  wise  order  to  the  world.  The world works in a certain way-according to the pattern of wisdom-so you can know the order and live by it if you possess wisdom. In a fallen world that has been broken by sin, this order generally works out now; but it will always work out  later.  Wisdom  gives  you  the  ability  to  perceive  God's  order  and  live  by  it. You  must  live  by  this  order.  Don't  try  to  live  against  the  grain  because  that  is ruinous. Microwaves were designed to work in a certain way. Certain materials are  not  supposed  to  go  into  them.  One  time  my  (  Jon's)  youngest  brother  was eating something from Taco Bell, and he had some sauce packets he had saved in  the  fridge.  He  wanted  to  warm  the  sauce  up,  so  he  put  the  packet  in  the microwave. What happened next? A light show  on par with the Fourth of July went off in our microwave! That's true with creation as well. If you live against the grain of how things work or how wisdom has ordered the world, it will go badly  for  you.  Solomon  tells  us  in  Proverbs  6  that  we  can  observe  ants  and deduce  that  hard  work  will  lead  to  provision  and  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty. You can observe that a soft answer cools fury. Dishonesty in the justice system will  destroy  a  society.  That's  just  the  way  that  the  world  works,  and  trying  to live against its order is suicidal. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Solomon suggest that wisdom can provide security from the perils of the wicked?", "Answer": "Solomon  appeals  to  his  son  to  not  let  wisdom  and  discretion  depart  from  his sight  because  they  are  life  (vv.  21-22).  Keep  the  wisdom  of  this  book  through Jesus, and it will keep you secure from the ruin of the wicked when that comes (v.  25).  Solomon's  point  is  that  wisdom  keeps  you  safe  from  sudden  trouble. That's why you should get wisdom above all else. You will walk safely during the  days  of  your  life,  and  you  will  sleep  peacefully  at  night.  This  is  an  appeal from a parent who desperately wants his child to be safe. Don't we all? He says you won't stumble if you keep walking on the wise path (again, this is generally true now but always ultimately true). "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon characterize the relationship between wisdom and safety in one's life?", "Answer": "Solomon  appeals  to  his  son  to  not  let  wisdom  and  discretion  depart  from  his sight  because  they  are  life  (vv.  21-22).  Keep  the  wisdom  of  this  book  through Jesus, and it will keep you secure from the ruin of the wicked when that comes (v.  25).

{"Question": "Can the absence of compassion towards others be construed as an indication of lacking God's love?", "Answer": "If anyone has this world's goods and sees a fellow believer in need but withholds compassion from him-how does God's love reside in him? Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth. "}
{"Question": "What is the importance of timely acts of kindness according to Proverbs 3:28?", "Answer": "Proverbs 3:28 fleshes this out. Don't delay in doing good if you have the means. Don't  put  it  off  because  you're  lazy,  and  then  forget.  Don't  put  it  off  because you  are  indifferent  or  selfish.  Don't  just  try  to  get  rid  of  the  person  with  an excuse like, \"I don't have any cash on me.\" Right then, go the extra mile to meet the need. Failing to do good to your neighbor when it is in your power is foolish and wicked. It is sin. "}
{"Question": "In what situations does Solomon suggest it is acceptable to seek justice against a neighbor?", "Answer": "Solomon moves from failing to do good to actively doing evil. Don't plan evil against your neighbor who lives trustingly beside you (v. 29). Don't accuse your neighbor without reason if they haven't wronged you (v. 30). This can refer to a false accusation for gain. You accuse them out of jealousy, or you do so in order to  get  something  that  belongs  to  them.  Solomon  acknowledges  that  it's  OK  to seek justice if there is an appropriate cause. You may have to take a neighbor to court to stop some injustice against your family, but you don't do it out of spite or to get even with them. And Paul makes clear that within the body of Christ this is not appropriate at all (1 Cor 6). "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon use the concept of rewards to motivate his son to pursue wisdom?", "Answer": "Wisdom  has  its  rewards,  and  Solomon  holds  them  out  to  his  son  as  a motivation to get wisdom. If you believe that Wisdom-Jesus-can make good on  these  rewards,  then  you  will  walk  in  these  ways.  The  devious  person-the person who goes against the created order-is detestable to Yahweh (3:32). And judgment will fall on you if you do not follow the golden rule to do unto others as you want them to do unto you. Solomon says there's a curse on the house of the  wicked  but  blessing  on  the  house  of  the  righteous  (v.  33).  This  encourages and  warns  us  that  our  actions  affect  more  than  just  us.  The  sins  of  the  parents will affect the children, and the righteousness of parents trying their best to walk after Jesus will affect them positively. This is language from Deuteronomy 27- 30. There is a choice between blessing (life) and curses (death) in obedience and disobedience.  There  is  a  choice  between  honor  and  dishonor  here  (Prov  3:34- 35). Don't mock or you'll be mocked. Humble yourself to receive grace from the Lord. "}
{"Question": "How does Jesus embody both the Wisdom of God and the humble wise son described in Proverbs?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus  is  the  Wisdom  of  God,  but  he's  also  the  wise  son  of  Proverbs  who humbled himself, took on the curse for us, and offers us the blessings of wisdom.

Miller, \"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\" 1922) "}
{"Question": "What are some examples of patterns of wisdom and patterns of foolishness mentioned in the text?", "Answer": "Instruction in wisdom should be a multigenerational thing. Parents have been entrusted with the responsibility of passing this down to their children. We can pass down patterns of foolishness like laziness, addiction, abuse, or passivity. Or we  can  pass  down  patterns  of  wisdom  like  humility,  a  good  work  ethic,  and responsibility. Proverbs 3:33 teaches us that we can bring blessing or cursing on our  house.  The  good  news  is  that  the  chain  of  wickedness  can  be  broken  with one  generation  that  pursues  the  Lord,  but  the  bad  news  is  that  a  chain  of faithfulness  can  be  broken  in  one  generation  as  well.  The  goal  of  Christian parenting is to pass down godly wisdom so that the chain will not be broken by your  children  or  grandchildren.  As  my  friend  Jimmy  Scroggins  has  said,  \"The goal  of  Christian  parenting  is  not  just  Christian  children;  it  is  Christian grandchildren.\" "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon connect wisdom with obedience to the law, as instructed by David?", "Answer": "Solomon says that David told him to let his heart keep his commands and live. Again, wisdom is tied to the law, and it must be obeyed from the inside out. It must  be  written  on  the  heart  (  Jer  31:33).  Practically,  wisdom  prolongs  life because it avoids the risky behaviors that bring premature death like addictions, disregarding governmental laws, or disregarding parents by running into traffic. The life that will not heed authoritative counsel will often end early. Eternal and abundant life is found in obedience to the law (Lev 18; Jesus is the fulfillment). "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon link obedience to authoritative counsel with the potential for a longer life?", "Answer": "Solomon says that David told him to let his heart keep his commands and live. Again, wisdom is tied to the law, and it must be obeyed from the inside out. It must  be  written  on  the  heart  (  Jer  31:33).  Practically,  wisdom  prolongs  life because it avoids the risky behaviors that bring premature death like addictions, disregarding governmental laws, or disregarding parents by running into traffic. The life that will not heed authoritative counsel will often end early. Eternal and abundant life is found in obedience to the law (Lev 18; Jesus is the fulfillment). "}
{"Question": "What are some key actions recommended in the text to help children know Jesus intimately?", "Answer": "So  the  multigenerational  task  is  to  introduce  our  children  to  Jesus  first,  then introduce our grandchildren to Jesus. This is most important. Read the Bible to your  children,  pray  with  them,  bring  them  to  church,  have  family  devotional time,  share  your  testimony  with  them,  let  them  see  you  worship  Jesus  in gatherings, let them see you participate in the ordinances, and share Jesus with them  so  they  can  know  him  intimately.  Then,  based  on  that  relationship  with Jesus and in that framework, teach them practical wisdom like how to be honest, how to fight anxiety, how to handle money, how to avoid get-rich-quick scams, how to receive a rebuke, how to lovingly give a rebuke, how to complete tasks like chores, and a thousand other things. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon convey the importance of wisdom as a guide to ethical living in Proverbs 1:10-19?", "Answer": "In verses 10-19 Solomon again exhorts his son to listen to his wise teaching in order  to  prolong  his  life  (v.  10).  We  have  seen  this  throughout  Proverbs. Solomon  says,  \"I  am  teaching  you  the  way  of  wisdom;  I  am  guiding  you  on straight  paths\"  (v.  11).  This  refers  to  the  wise  course  of  life.  It's  the  ethical course to take because it is the \"straight\" path. Wisdom is a person to know and a path to walk. Solomon says that since his son has embraced Wisdom, now he must  stay  on  the  path  of  wisdom,  that  is,  the  path  of  morality  and  the  safest course (v. 12). Keep hold of Wisdom, and she will be your life (v. 13). Do not walk  on  the  wicked  path  (v.  14).  Again,  wisdom  is  not  intelligence,  and foolishness  is  not  morally  neutral.  The  idiot  friend  on  every  sitcom  is  not  the biblical  picture  of  folly.  Solomon  lays  out  the  \"doctrine  of  two  paths\"  (Fox, Proverbs  1-9,  128-31).  There  are  two  roads  or  ways:  (1)  the  wise,  righteous  path that leads to life and (2) the foolish, wicked path that leads to death. "}
{"Question": "In what ways is the concept of wisdom portrayed as a life-long journey in the text?", "Answer": "Wisdom  is  a  path  or  course  of  life.  Wisdom  is  a  progressive  thing;  it  is  not something  you  arrive  at.  This  is  very  similar  to  the  New  Testament  idea  of sanctification,  where  we  \"walk\"  in  the  Spirit  (Gal  5:16,25).  You  are  being conformed into the image of Christ, and this will take your whole life. You start down the path through Jesus; after all, he is \"the way\" ( John 14:6). You must know the person of Wisdom to walk in the way of wisdom (Prov 4:13-14). "}
{"Question": "What cautionary advice does the text provide regarding following the ways of the wicked?", "Answer": "Don't follow the wicked way that seems right at the time because those on the way  of  evil  eat,  drink,  and  sleep  foolishness  and  wickedness-and  they  want others  to  join  them  (vv.  16-17).  They  will  tempt  you  to  follow  them  into laziness, gossip, quick-temperedness, and other degeneracy. In contrast, the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day (v. 18). The righteous way is a path of progressing in holiness until the last day. Just like the sun is seen at dawn and then gets brighter and brighter until it reaches its zenith, so those who walk on the path of wisdom will see more and more of the path and walk in greater and greater wisdom until the day they are made  truly  wise  in  the  presence  of  Jesus.  The  way  of  the  wicked  is  a  path  of deep darkness where they do not know what they stumble over. "}
{"Question": "How does foolishness hinder one's ability to perceive reality accurately?", "Answer": "Foolishness keeps you from seeing rightly. You may think you are taking the right  step.  It  may  seem  right  to  you,  but  you  do  not  see  that  you  will  stumble. Wisdom  is  progressive  like  the  soft  light  of  dawn  growing  into  full  midday brightness.  One  day  we  will  see  completely  clearly  (resurrection  day;  see  Dan 12). We get a taste of that now through wisdom. We will get the fullness later. "}
{"Question": "Can we infer from the text that the full comprehension of wisdom is reserved for a future time?", "Answer": "Foolishness keeps you from seeing rightly. You may think you are taking the right  step.  It  may  seem  right  to  you,  but  you  do  not  see  that  you  will  stumble. Wisdom  is  progressive  like  the  soft  light  of  dawn  growing  into  full  midday brightness.  One  day  we  will  see  completely  clearly  (resurrection  day;  see  Dan 12). We get a taste of that now through wisdom. We will get the fullness later. "}
{"Question": "What methods does the text mention for attempting to overcome patterns of sin or unwise behavior?", "Answer": "In the same way, has there ever been a sinful or foolish behavior in your life that  you  just  could  not  stop?  You  may  have  even  begged  God  to  take  it  away. You know it's wrong, destructive, sinful, and unwise, but you just can't stop. It's a continual struggle. There are sin patterns that we try to break but can't. We try to modify the behavior. We say, \"It's bad, so stop it!\" We may even put guards in place that help for a little while, but eventually the guards are not enough. For example,  you  recognize  that  you  have  a  porn  problem  so  you  put  guarding software on your computer to keep you from going to those sites. Things go well for a little while, but then you learn to get around the software, or you look at it on your phone. Or you've got a problem with your temper. You explode in anger at your children. So in order to modify the behavior, you decide you'll count to ten  before  responding  to  anything.  But  sometimes  you  forget  to  count  because you're just so angry. "}
{"Question": "What impact does the brokenness at the heart level have on human inclinations and behaviors?", "Answer": "This  is  a  problem  for  all  of  us.  We  are  all  sinners  by  nature,  so  we  are  all broken  at  the  heart  level  and  bent  toward  sin.  That  means  we  love  things  that God  hates,  and  we  hate  things  that  God  loves.  So  we  can  try  to  modify  the behavior,  but  it  won't  bring  lasting  change  because  we  are  only  treating  the symptoms and not the source. "}
{"Question": "What role does righteousness play in the son's commitment to live by the law?", "Answer": "Proverbs  continually  teaches  us  that  Wisdom  is  a  person  to  love  and  a  path  to walk.  The  father  continues  to  encourage  his  son  to  stay  on  the  right  path.  The son must daily live the law by walking in righteousness. But he must have a new heart with the law written on it to do so. "}
{"Question": "How does outward behavior serve as a mirror reflecting the inner state of an individual's heart?", "Answer": "Your  behavior  reveals  the  state  of  your  heart.  Outward  gossip  can  reveal jealousy, bitterness, or pride in the heart. Adultery or pornography reveals lust in the heart. For real and lasting change to happen in your life, you need to assess what's happening in your heart. Maybe your money problems can be traced back to  a  lack  of  contentment  in  God  in  your  heart.  Maybe  the  lies  you  tell  reveal insecurity in your heart where you worship the approval of others. Examine your heart to figure out the motivations for your behavior. "}
{"Question": "How is foolishness equated with \"lacking a heart\" in the book of Proverbs?", "Answer": "Since we all have heart issues, we need new hearts for real and lasting change. Deuteronomy  said  that  we  fail  to  obey  the  law  because  we  lack  the  hearts  to obey (Deut 5:29; 10:6; 29:3). But it also promised that one day the Lord would perform an inner transformation of the heart that would enable obedience (Deut 30:6). This promise is repeated in Ezekiel where the Lord says he will give his follower a new heart (Ezek 36:26) and in Jeremiah where the Lord says he will write  the  law  on  our  hearts  (  Jer  31:33).  Proverbs  promises  the  same-a  new heart with the law written on it (Prov 3:3; 7:3). Foolishness, or \"lacking sense,\" is described in the Hebrew of Proverbs as literally \"lacking a heart\" (6:32; 7:7; 9:4;  10:13;  11:12;  12:11;  17:18;  24:30;  cf.  Deut  5:29).  The  adulterer  lacks  a heart (Prov 6:32; 7:7). Woman Wisdom and Woman Folly seek the affection of the one who lacks heart (9:4,16). The one who lacks heart will die (10:21). The lazy  fool  is  one  who  lacks  a  heart  (24:30).  In  contrast,  the  wise  person  who listens to wisdom \"acquires\" a heart (15:32; cf. Ezek 36:26). "}

{"Question": "In what ways does Solomon suggest that one's speech and actions reflect the state of their heart?", "Answer": "Solomon is very concerned that his son get this-and we need to get it too- because we cannot walk in the wisdom of Proverbs 10-31 that leads to life if we do not have a new heart. If you are off the path of the wisdom of this book, it is because  your  heart  is  not  right.  You  can  see  this  in  your  speech  and  actions.

{"Question": "How does having a new heart affect one's ability to align with the wisdom presented in Proverbs?", "Answer": "Solomon is very concerned that his son get this-and we need to get it too- because we cannot walk in the wisdom of Proverbs 10-31 that leads to life if we do not have a new heart.

{"Question": "What role does Jesus play in the process of obtaining a new heart and spiritual empowerment?", "Answer": "Conclusion Change must take place at the heart level. That, not behavior modification, is the message of Christianity. You need to be born again by Jesus, and then the Spirit of Jesus will empower you to work on your heart issues. Proverbs hopes for this here, and Jesus gives it. This is absolutely critical because Jesus says that only the pure in heart will see God. That means that we have a big problem because our hearts aren't pure (20:9). But here is the good news: Jesus lived the life you couldn't live, died the death you should've died, and was raised from the dead. He  will  grant  his  Spirit  and  a  new  heart  to  all  who  believe  in  him.  He  will account  you  righteous  before  God,  and  then  he  will  begin  the  work  of progressively  growing  you  in  righteousness  by  the  power  of  his  Spirit  through the  Word.  So  it's  OK  to  not  be  OK,  but  it's  not  OK  to  stay  that  way.  Ask yourself some probing questions: Do I have a new heart? What do my struggles reveal about my heart?

{"Question": "What impact did the pastor's actions have on his wife, children, and church community?", "Answer": "A. Horizontally, be satisfied in your spouse (5:15-20). B. Vertically, be in a saving relationship with Jesus (7:4). few  years  ago  a  pastor  friend  of  mine  walked  away  from  his  wife  and A children for a woman on his staff. When he was confronted about his sin, his response  was,  \"I  know  it's  wrong,  but  I'm  going  to  do  it  anyway.  I  know  that God will forgive me.\" This was obviously devastating to his wife, his children, and his church. It was heartbreaking, but it did not happen overnight. This pastor had developed a problem with porn at the age of twelve. There were times when it was worse than others. There were times that he got caught, repented, sought counseling, and seemed to be freed of it. But something that started out as small as a few looks at a magazine as a pubescent boy ended up destroying his family and ministry. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon emphasize the dangerous nature of sexual sin in his teachings?", "Answer": "Sexual  sin  is  not  something  to  flirt  with  or  to  keep  secret  and  hope  it  goes away before someone finds out.

{"Question": "What advice does Solomon offer in Proverbs 5-7 to caution against the dangers of sexual sin?", "Answer": "Sexual  sin  is  not  something  to  flirt  with  or  to  keep  secret  and  hope  it  goes away before someone finds out. It's a killer. Solomon warns us repeatedly about this in Proverbs 5-7. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon's personal experience inform his advice to his son about avoiding sexual sin?", "Answer": "Don't Fall into Sexual Sin Solomon  knows  this  topic  well  since  he  repeatedly  messed  up  big  time  with \"forbidden\"  women  (see  1  Kgs  11:3;  he  had  seven  hundred  wives  and  three hundred concubines). He warns his son not to fall for the forbidden or immoral woman  (i.e.,  sexual  sin).  This  is  a  parental  responsibility  dads  and  moms  have with their children (Prov 6:20). You should have \"the talk\" with your children; in fact, you should have multiple talks. Solomon speaks continuously to his son throughout  this  book.  Parent,  you  need  to  be  the  expert  on  sex  with  your children.  Do  not  abdicate  that  responsibility  to  TV,  the  Internet,  or  your children's peers simply because talking about it may be \"weird.\" And churches also  need  to  be  experts  on  sex  instead  of  avoiding  the  subject.  God  talks  a  lot about it. Sex is a powerful gift from God, and we need to proclaim the beauty of sex in marriage as Solomon does here (and also in the Song of Songs). "}
{"Question": "What are some common cultural misconceptions about sexuality that the text addresses?", "Answer": "The smooth words may not be the communication of an individual; they may be  messages  you  are  being  bombarded  with  in  the  culture:  \"Don't  get  married too young. Delay marriage as long as you can so that you know you are ready.\" This causes unfaithfulness to your future spouse as you fool around right now. \"It's  OK  to  mess  around.  How  else  will  you  know  what  you  like  sexually?\" \"Guys  like  girls  who  are  more  sexually  active.  If  you  don't  act  somewhat aggressive, he won't want you.\" Wrong! The lies of culture enter your ear and heart:  \"Infidelity  is  hotter  than  monogamy.\"  \"Follow  your  heart.\"  \"Do  what makes you happy.\" Maybe the message is in your own head: \"My spouse isn't as romantic with me as she should be, so . . .\" "}
{"Question": "How can reading romance novels impact a woman's perception of her spouse and her relationship?", "Answer": "For  some  women  it  might  be  reading  romance  novels.  You  read  the  Twilight novels or Fifty Shades of Grey. These books cause you to emotionally invest in a man who is not your husband. They cause you to be dissatisfied with your husband. \"I wish my husband was more sensitive to my needs like the man in this book.\" \"I  wish  my  husband  was  romantic  like  this  man  in  the  book.\"  \"I  wish  my husband listened to my inmost thoughts like the man in this book.\" This is also the  seduction  of  pornography  whether  in  picture  or  print.  Porn  offers,  to  men, women  who  act  more  like  men  (i.e.,  sexually  aggressive)  and,  to  women,  men who  act  like  more  like  women  (i.e.,  emotionally  sensitive).  This  causes  you  to paint  a  picture  in  your  mind  of  the  ideal  spouse.  If  that  picture  is  not  your spouse, you are in danger! "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon caution against the allure of looks as a gateway to unfaithfulness and sexual sin?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  that  besides  words  there  is  a  second  means  that  allures  you  to unfaithfulness, and that is looks. Attraction draws you into sexual sin. Solomon warns his son in Proverbs 6:25, \"Don't lust in your heart for her beauty.\" Lust starts  in  the  heart  before  the  act.  Jesus  also  tells  us  this  in  Matthew  5.  We  see things with our eyes, and it draws us away from our spouse. It starts fantasies in the mind. It might be pornography, inappropriate TV shows, or sexually explicit movies.  Porn  is  a  brutal  killer  right  now  because  you  can  get  it  on  your  cell phone, iPad, or computer with little effort. This should be a warning to parents about giving their children unfettered access to the Internet. Really think before you give your children a smart phone. "}

{"Question": "In what scenario does the text suggest the possibility of experiencing public disgrace and shame?", "Answer": "You  may  lose  your  health  (v.  11;  perhaps  an  STD).  You  will  be  filled  with regret that you did not listen when you had the chance (vv. 12-13). It's foolish to not listen to a rebuke. Perhaps your wife came to you with concerns about a new relationship  you  were  developing,  and  you  responded  to  her  in  anger.  \"You're crazy. You don't know what you're talking about. Stop making a big deal out of this. There's nothing there.\" You attacked her and made her feel like an idiot for her concern. Do you get defensive when confronted on these things? If so, you are  the  idiot!  This  is  your  wife  or  your  husband  protecting  you.  You  were convinced they were overreacting, but now you wish you had listened! You may also experience public disgrace and shame in the assembly (v. 14). "}
{"Question": "In what way does Solomon differentiate between the costs associated with prostitution and adultery?", "Answer": "Solomon says in Proverbs 6:20-35 that sexual sin may cost you your life. He speaks practically about the cost of adultery. He says the price for a prostitute is like the cost of bread (v. 26). He is not condoning prostitution. He is just saying that it is less costly because it usually destroys just one family whereas adultery destroys two families. He says adultery is more costly because it may cost you your life (v. 34). I heard the story of a man who went into a Sunday school class to beat up a man who had an affair with his wife. Revenge is a reality! "}

{"Question": "What are the potential consequences of engaging in sexual sin, as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "Sexual sin may just cost your life as you know it. You lose the respect of your children  or  you  lose  your  family.  But  it  may  cost  you  your  physical  life  if  the husband  wants  revenge.  You  cannot  play  with  fire  without  getting  burned; likewise, you cannot mess with sexual sin without it wrecking your life (vv. 27- 28).  This  wound  of  shame,  disgrace,  and  possible  death  is  not  worth  a  few minutes  of  pleasure.  And  the  biggest  problem  is  that  these  temporal consequences  are  not  even  the  worst  part.  They  are  just  a  foretaste  of  hell because the wages of sexual sin is death (Rom 6:23). "}

{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs convey the initial allure of sexual sin versus its ultimate outcome?", "Answer": "Sexual Sin Will Destroy You Eternally (5:21-23; 7:10-27) Even if you do not die now, you will die later. This sin seems so appealing and sweet like honey, but in the end it is bitter and deadly (5:3-5). Proverbs 7:22-23 pictures this as an ignorant cow being led along to become a steak for someone's dinner,  an  oblivious  deer  that  is  shot  through  the  vitals  by  a  hunter,  or  an unsuspecting bird that gets trapped. These poor, stupid animals were just going about their business and did not know that one second later their life would be over! "}

{"Question": "How does Solomon emphasize the importance of accountability for sexual sin in his teachings?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  not  to  be  intoxicated  with  this  sexual  sin  because  the  Lord  is watching (5:21). If you think no one will find out, you are foolish. God sees all of our sexual sin. We will be held accountable for it on judgment day. It will not go unnoticed. Even if by chance we avoid all of the consequences in this life, we will not avoid judgment. The church has been too focused lately on self-help. So we often merely talk about sexual sin at the level of temporal consequences. Our appeal is to our self-centeredness: \"C'mon, you don't want to get pregnant, do you? You don't want to get an STD, do you? You don't want to ruin intimacy for your future marriage, do you? You don't want to lose your money, do you?\" We  are  so  afraid  to  use  the  word  hell  because  we  don't  want  to  seem  old- fashioned. But  we need  to use  this  word because  sexual sin  will  drag  us  there. Solomon  makes  this  clear  throughout  Proverbs  5-7.  This  raises  an  important question. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon distinguish between the vertical and horizontal approaches to combating sin?", "Answer": "How Do We Fight It? Solomon  gives  us  two  ways  to  fight  this  sin:  vertical  and  horizontal.  Your vertical  relationship  with  the  Lord  must  be  right  in  order  for  your  horizontal relationship with your spouse to be right. These work in concert. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon utilize vivid imagery to emphasize the importance of fidelity within marriage?", "Answer": "Solomon  uses  graphic  imagery  when  he  says,  \"Drink  water  from  your  own cistern\"  (v.  15;  cf.  Song  1:2-3;  4:1-7).  He  says,  \"Take  pleasure  in  the  wife  of your  youth\"  (v.  18;  you  got  married  young,  and  you're  still  together!).  He exhorts  his  son  to  be  intoxicated  with  her  breasts  and  her  love  (5:19).  As Tremper  Longman  said,  \"The  best  defense  against  committing  adultery  is  a strong  offense  in  marriage\"  (Proverbs,  158).  Solomon  does  not  even  mention procreation  here.  Experiencing  regular  sexual  pleasure  in  marriage  will  guard against unfaithfulness. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Solomon advocate for the nurturing and enjoyment of the marital relationship?", "Answer": "Solomon  uses  graphic  imagery  when  he  says,  \"Drink  water  from  your  own cistern\"  (v.  15;  cf.  Song  1:2-3;  4:1-7).  He  says,  \"Take  pleasure  in  the  wife  of your  youth\"  (v.  18;  you  got  married  young,  and  you're  still  together!).  He exhorts  his  son  to  be  intoxicated  with  her  breasts  and  her  love  (5:19).

{"Question": "What analogy is used in the text to illustrate the impact of sin on the proper use of sex?", "Answer": "Conclusion God created his world good and everything worked right, including relationships and sex. But sin broke our relationship with God and with each other, so nothing right  now  works  as  it  was  designed.  Instead  of  intimacy  and  satisfaction  in marriage, there are distrust, barriers, and unfaithfulness. Sex is still a good, God- given  gift,  but  it  is  not  used  properly  because  we  are  sinners.  Fire  can  be  both good and destructive. When it is in a fireplace it can warm a house so you do not freeze in the winter, but when it is outside the fireplace it will destroy the house. Like  a  fire,  sex  is  very  good  in  the  right  context  (i.e.,  marriage)  but  very destructive  in  the  wrong  context.  Because  of  our  sinful  nature,  we  use  sex  in destructive ways that God never intended. "}

{"Question": "How does marrying wisdom align with Jesus' emphasis on truth and reality, as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "I. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Tells You the Truth about Reality (8:1-11). II. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Produces Right Living in His Followers (8:12-16). III. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Rewards His Followers (8:17-21). IV.

{"Question": "How does Solomon convey the concept of wisdom as a person in Proverbs 8?", "Answer": "This is the question that Solomon wants to answer for his son in Proverbs 8. Solomon has told us repeatedly that wisdom is not a set of ideas; Wisdom is a person.  Solomon  has  repeatedly  tried  to  get  his  son  to  marry  Wisdom.  Here  in Proverbs 8 he makes another push by telling him why he should marry her. He details all of her amazing qualities (Kidner, Wisdom of Proverbs, 22-24).13 "}

{"Question": "What message is Proverbs 8 conveying regarding choosing Jesus above all else for eternal wisdom?", "Answer": "We  find  out  in  this  chapter  that  Wisdom  does  not  just  stand  for  Solomon's wisdom; it stands for God's Wisdom. In the fullness of time, Paul reveals to us that  Jesus  is  the  Wisdom  of  God  (1  Cor  1:24,30).  So,  through  the  Spirit, Proverbs 8 is exhorting us to be in a personal relationship with Jesus because of all his amazing attributes. You cannot be wise or have skill at life without this relationship.  Choose  Jesus  over  anything  or  anyone  else  because  he  will  make you wise now and forever. As you read the entirety of Proverbs 8, ask yourself the question: Who in the world can this be describing? "}
{"Question": "Why does Wisdom choose to proclaim her message in public places with large crowds of people?", "Answer": "Wisdom cries out in the public places where there are tons of people because she  wants  everyone  to  hear.  Wisdom  is  competing  against  rivals  (i.e.,  the immoral  woman  of  Proverbs  5-7  and  the  Woman  Folly  in  Proverbs  9)  for  the people's attention. Her activity is in broad daylight instead of at nightfall (7:9). Wisdom  stands  at  the  public  crossroads  (8:2)  where  a  decision  must  be  made (Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 265).14 Whom will you follow? Folly (cf. 9:13-18)? Wisdom? She wants everyone's attention and allegiance. She calls out to all of humanity, especially  the  inexperienced  and  the  fools.  She  will  teach  them  common  sense (8:5). She can make them wise-that's why they should listen. You should listen to Wisdom-Jesus-because he can make you wise. "}
{"Question": "What fundamental concepts about life does the text convey through the character of Wisdom?", "Answer": "Listen  to  her  because  she  speaks  the  truth  and  tells  you  the  way  the  world really works (8:6-9). She tells you what is \"right\"-the difference between good and evil. Not only morality, but she tells you the order of the world, and she does not twist or pervert that order. That is what her teaching in the rest of the book is about. Hard work is better than laziness or get-rich-quick schemes. While it may seem  like  indulging  pleasure  will  gladden  you,  it  will  actually  sadden  you  (cf. 21:17).  Wisdom  tells  it  like  it  really  is,  whereas  Folly  twists  things.  Folly  tells you  what  you  want  to  hear  but  not  what  you  need  to  hear.  Take  the  short  cut, indulge pleasure, hoard your possessions, hold a grudge, and more. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs emphasize the importance of prioritizing Wisdom over worldly riches and desires?", "Answer": "The perceptive person knows that Wisdom's words are right and that they will help  him  or  her  to  navigate  through  this  life,  so  they  submit  to  her  (8:9). Following Wisdom's instruction is better than riches because Wisdom is vastly superior  to  worldly  wealth  (vv.  10-11).  Nothing  you  desire  can  compare  with Wisdom.  Wisdom  is  the  pearl  of  great  price.  This  is  what  Proverbs  teaches. Money  can  be  a  good  thing  if  it  is  not  given  first  place  in  your  life.  After  all, Jesus says you cannot serve two masters (Matt 6:24). Wisdom will not tolerate rivals. So seek Wisdom first, and all these things will be added to you! Make a faith decision to get Wisdom-Jesus-and be satisfied in him above all else. "}

{"Question": "What are the key qualities associated with Wisdom as mentioned in the text?", "Answer": "Wisdom has associates that she will share with you: shrewdness, knowledge, and discretion. If you want these qualities, you have to know Wisdom. If you want these qualities, you have to go to Jesus. The ability to make right decisions, the ability to carefully consider a situation without making a snap judgment, and the ability  to  read  people  are  available  through  a  relationship  with  Jesus.  Wisdom teaches you how to navigate life in a way that avoids your ruining things. "}
{"Question": "What qualities or traits does wisdom encourage in individuals, as indicated in the text?", "Answer": "Wisdom  here  first  shows  you  who  to  associate  with,  and  then  she  tells  you whom  to  avoid.  The  fear  of  Yahweh,  which  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom,  is  to hate evil (v. 13). She hates pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted speech (we  saw  that  earlier  in  the  text).  She  despises  those  who  won't  humble themselves under authority and counsel. She will keep you off the wicked path if you embrace her. She will produce counsel, sound wisdom, insight, and strength in her followers (v. 14). Strength reveals that wisdom is not simply the ability to discern the right decision, but it's also the wherewithal to carry it out. "}

{"Question": "How is the promise of wisdom in Isaiah 11 tied to the reordering of creation by the Messiah?", "Answer": "Wisdom  is  the  means  by  which  kings  reign  and  decree  justice.  Wisdom  is needed to rule and establish the kingdom. Wisdom is how a king will order his kingdom.  Solomon  recognized  this  so  he  asked  for  wisdom  in  1  Kings  3. Wisdom is the skill to rule. This is promised of the coming Messiah in Isaiah 11. He will reorder the entire creation through wisdom. Jesus is the fulfillment. He is the  Messiah  who  patterns  his  kingdom  after  wisdom  (see  the  Sermon  on  the Mount in Matt 5-7). Those of us who follow Christ will also rule with him, so we need the wisdom of this book. We are in an internship for eternity right now. "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of love feature in the pursuit of wisdom, as expressed in the passage?", "Answer": "Wisdom says, \"I love those who love me, and those who search for me find me\" (v. 17; cf. Matt 7:7). So commit to the wisdom of Proverbs and commit to the Wisdom of Proverbs-the word and the Word (cf. John 1). In order for you to live out the word, you must first be in a personal relationship with Jesus. "}
{"Question": "How does the description of Wisdom in this section suggest a divine and transcendent nature?", "Answer": "This  section  is  rich  and  complicated.  We  see  a  heightening  of  Wisdom's description. Wisdom is presented here not just as Solomon's wisdom but rather as Yahweh's Wisdom. Wisdom is the only begotten child of God (v. 22). We see that  this  description  of  Wisdom  can  no  longer  be  seen  just  as  a  poetic  device. The description is too lofty, and it is too much like Jesus. After all, Revelation 3:14  calls  Jesus  \"the  originator  of  God's  creation\"  (Nestle,  Novum  Testamentum "}
{"Question": "Can we infer from the passage that sin is both morally wrong and pragmatically damaging? ", "Answer": "There  is  a  design  in  the  way  that  the  world  works,  and  this  order  can  be observed by anyone who is looking (e.g., at the ant in Prov 6). If you try to live against the grain of this order, it will injure you. Adultery will cause you to lose much  of  what  you  have.  The  famous  golfer  Tiger  Woods  can  attest  to  this. Unchecked greed will lead to much debt. The American government can attest to this. Laziness will lead to inability to hold down a job and failure to provide for your family. There is a way that the world works. You see, it is not just that sin is wrong, although it is. Sin is also destructive. "}
{"Question": "How has Christianity historically expressed the teachings found in Proverbs 8 through song?", "Answer": "Christianity has confessed for a long time in song what Proverbs 8 has taught us. The Wisdom of God, who ordered the cosmos and can teach us the right path, took on flesh in Bethlehem ( John 1:14). If you want to be wise in daily life-if you want to know how the world works-then you must be in a relationship with him. If you're not walking in wisdom, it reveals an issue with Jesus in your life. Confess that to him, turn from it, and let him reorder your life like he orders the universe. "}
{"Question": "What invitation does the text propose regarding becoming wise and receiving life from Jesus?", "Answer": "I. Accept the Invitation of Wisdom-Jesus-to Become Wise and Receive Life (9:1-6). II. How You Act Reveals Which Invitation You Have Accepted (9:7-12). III. Reject the Deadly Invitation of Folly-Idols (9:13-18). "}
{"Question": "How are the invitations from Wisdom and Folly characterized in the passage?", "Answer": "There  are  two  competing  invitations  given  in  this  chapter.  There  is  an invitation from Wisdom ( Jesus) to a party, and there is an invitation from Folly (idols or Satan) to a party. Which will you accept? If you accept the invitation of Wisdom  (  Jesus),  you  will  be  made  wise  and  receive  true  life  forever.  On  the other hand, if you accept the invitation of Folly (idols or Satan), you will be a fool who wrecks his life and then perishes. "}

{"Question": "How does one's actions in daily life serve as indicators of their acceptance of Jesus's invitation?", "Answer": "This has huge implications for your life right now-for the nitty-gritty details of your life. If you want to live the wise life and receive eternal life, you must accept  Jesus's  invitation.  If  you  are  walking  in  wisdom  in  your  daily  life  right now, it shows that you have accepted Jesus's invitation. It reveals that you are walking toward him, walking with him, and trusting in him. On the other hand, if you're walking in foolishness, it shows that you are walking toward idols (Satan) and trusting in them. This is revealed in the seemingly mundane details of your life  according  to  Proverbs.  If  you  are  lazy,  quarrelsome,  cannot  accept correction, cannot pay the bills on time, or your kids run amok, it is because you are acting like an idolater! But if you work hard, can be trusted with secrets, and can correct your kids, then you are acting like a follower of Jesus. "}
{"Question": "How does the personification of Wisdom in the text relate to Solomon's wisdom and God's Wisdom?", "Answer": "Wisdom built her house, and it is a temple because it's at the highest point of the city  (v.  3).  Perhaps  Solomon's  temple  had  \"seven  pillars\"  (cf.  1  Kgs  7:17) (Murphy  and  Huwiler,  Proverbs,  42).  As  we  have  seen,  Wisdom  is  a personification of Solomon's wisdom and God's Wisdom; and this poetic device points  to  Jesus,  so  it  is  natural  for  Wisdom  to  dwell  in  a  temple.  As  we  have seen,  Wisdom  built  creation  (Prov  3;  8),  the  tabernacle  (Exod  31),  and  the temple (1 Kgs 7). Wisdom here prepares a marriage feast of meat and wine. As in  Isaiah  55,  this  meal  is  free.  As  in  Isaiah  25,  this  meal  gives  life  (Prov  9:6). Through her maids, Wisdom invites everyone in the most public places to come to  the  party  (v.  3),  especially  those  who  lack  a  heart  and  need  a  new  one.  The phrase  translated  \"lacks  sense\"  in  verse  4  literally  says  \"lacks  a  heart.\"  The inexperienced are those who have not yet made a decision. Wisdom calls to them to turn in at her house, come to her party, eat her feast, and drink her wine. This is very similar to the parables in Matthew 22 and Luke 14, where the kingdom of God  is  compared  to  a  wedding  feast-a  banquet.  All  are  ultimately  invited  to this feast. The servants are sent out to the highways and hedges to invite all. This meal gives life, and those who refuse it will die. "}
{"Question": "What symbolic significance does Wisdom dwelling in a temple hold within the context of the text?", "Answer": "Wisdom built her house, and it is a temple because it's at the highest point of the city  (v.  3).

{"Question": "In what ways does the meal prepared by Wisdom symbolize themes of generosity and life?", "Answer": "Wisdom built her house, and it is a temple because it's at the highest point of the city  (v.  3).  Perhaps  Solomon's  temple  had  \"seven  pillars\"  (cf.  1  Kgs  7:17) (Murphy  and  Huwiler,  Proverbs,  42).

{"Question": "What does wisdom, as described in the verses, entail in terms of discernment and correction?", "Answer": "So  according  to  these  verses,  wisdom  is  the  discernment  to  know  whom  to correct and whom not to correct. You do this by discerning the outcome. How will your correction be received? This is wisdom. Since Jesus is the Wisdom of God,  that  means  being  formed  into  Christlikeness  is  not  just  growing  in  a reduction  of  sinfulness,  although  that  is  part  of  it.  It  is  also  growth  in discernment. Being like Jesus means having the ability to see the situation you are in. It means recognizing when to correct people and when not to correct them because it will only make things worse. It also means knowing when not to play the coward and to speak up and say something in the right situation. "}
{"Question": "Can we infer from the text that the ability to accept correction is a key indicator of wisdom?", "Answer": "There is also the implication in these verses that if you are the kind of person who cannot accept correction, you are a mocker. If you get angry when someone confronts you, you are a mocker. On the other hand, if you can humbly accept correction because you know you have not arrived, then you are wise, and you will love the person who had the courage to confront you. How do you respond to  confrontation?  Do  you  automatically  get  angry?  Or  do  you  listen  and  try  to see the truth in it? Do you have any relationship where someone has the freedom to ask you tough questions? Wisdom is the ability to hear and respond correctly to criticism so that you don't repeat the same mistakes. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs suggest that a porn addiction may be linked to idolatry of sex?", "Answer": "The  point  of  Proverbs  9  is  that  if  you  cannot  accept  a  rebuke,  it  is  not  just because  that  is  your  personality  type;  it  reveals  idolatry  in  your  life  (perhaps worship of self). This is true in all kinds of practical areas that Proverbs touches on.  If  you  are  stingy,  it  reveals  an  idolatry  of  money.  If  you  have  a  porn addiction,  it  reveals  an  idol  of  sex.  If  you  cannot  discipline  your  children,  it might reveal that you have made your kids an idol. "}
{"Question": "What is the outcome that Wisdom promises if one chooses her over other alternatives?", "Answer": "This is the last time Wisdom talks. She urges you to pick wisdom, but it's your choice. If you pick her, it will lead to life (v. 11). She will produce wisdom in you and reward you with longer life. But you are responsible to make your own decision, and how you live reveals which invitation you accepted. "}
{"Question": "How is Folly represented in Proverbs, and what consequences are associated with embracing her?", "Answer": "The  forbidden  woman  is  now  personified  as  Folly.  Woman  Folly  is  the  power behind  this  forbidden  woman.  Embracing  Woman  Folly  will  lead  to  the  same place as embracing the forbidden woman-the grave (5:5; 9:18). The forbidden woman epitomizes folly ( just like the noble wife epitomizes Woman Wisdom; ch. 31). This Woman Folly is a counterfeit who copies but perverts everything Wisdom does. Folly's house is a temple too because it is at the highest point of the  city  (9:14).  This  is  how  we  know  that  Folly  stands  for  idols  (Longman, Proverbs, 222). Turning away from Wisdom was characterized as unfaithfulness to God  (1:32).  One  is  unfaithful  to  God  when  one  is  whoring  after  idols.  That's exactly what's happening here. "}
{"Question": "How does Woman Folly conceal the true repercussions of her offerings from her victims?", "Answer": "Woman  Folly  is  loud,  seductive,  ignorant,  and  lazy  (9:13-14).  She  will produce this in her followers. She invites everyone to her party (vv. 15-16). She calls out to the same crowd as Wisdom-those who lack heart. She says to turn in at her house, come to her party. Her meal is illicit. Her water is stolen, and her bread  is  to  be  eaten  in  secret.  This  may  seem  \"tasty\"  (v.  17),  but  the  way  that seems right will not end well. Picking up on Proverbs 5:15, where water refers to sex, this seems to be an invitation to an affair. She's not just offering food and drink;  she's  offering  herself  as  food  and  drink.  She's  offering  an  illicit relationship  that  will  lead  to  apostasy,  to  walking  away  from  God.  Solomon knows  that  sexual  sin  leads  to  abandoning  God.  We  see  that  she  seduces  her victims by giving them half-truths. Yes, this affair will bring temporary pleasure, but  she  does  not  reveal  the  death  that  awaits  them  (v.  18).  That's  what foolishness is. Foolishness is not seeing the connection between your actions and their consequences. Like a cow walking into a slaughterhouse, you don't know that  you're  about  to  become  filet  mignon.  Her  guests  do  not  realize  that accepting her invitation is accepting an invitation to their own funeral. They go into the grave (v. 18; \"depths of Sheol\"). There may be a destruction now like public  shame,  loss  of  family,  or  loss  of  money;  but  all  of  that  is  simply  a foretaste of what's to come-hell. "}
{"Question": "How does Jesus embody wisdom through his actions of taking on the punishment for our foolishness?", "Answer": "Jesus  lived  a  perfectly  wise  life,  yet  he  took  the  punishment  our  foolishness deserved. He went into Sheol-the grave-and came back in victory three days later. He invites you to accept forgiveness from him. If you do, he will transform you into a wise person. The choice is yours! If you are an unbeliever, recognize the  foolishness  in  your  life,  repent  for  the  first  time,  and  come  to  Jesus  for salvation. If you are a believer, ask the Lord to reveal your foolishness to you, then confess it to him, repent of it, run to Jesus, and ask to be made like him. "}
{"Question": "How does Jesus facilitate wisdom concerning work and finances, as indicated in 10:2-5?", "Answer": "I. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Work and Money (10:2-5). II. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Words and Mouth (10:8). III. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Relationships (10:1,12). IV. Jesus Produces Wisdom That Leads to Rewards in Your Life and the Life to Come (10:24-32). "}
{"Question": "How does the introduction of Proverbs 10 mark a shift in the style and content of the text?", "Answer": "P roverbs 10 starts a new section in Proverbs. This is what we think of today when  we  think  about  Proverbs:  the  one-or  two-line  sayings  of  earthy wisdom  in  Proverbs  10-31.  We  will  look  at  this  chapter  to  learn  how  to  read Proverbs. We cannot cover all of it, but we want to answer the question, How do you read Proverbs? How do you understand the book? "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs 10-31 serve as a guide for interpreting the entire book of Proverbs?", "Answer": "P roverbs 10 starts a new section in Proverbs. This is what we think of today when  we  think  about  Proverbs:  the  one-or  two-line  sayings  of  earthy wisdom  in  Proverbs  10-31.  We  will  look  at  this  chapter  to  learn  how  to  read Proverbs. We cannot cover all of it, but we want to answer the question, How do you read Proverbs? How do you understand the book? "}
{"Question": "How are the behaviors outlined in Proverbs 10-31 related to one's status as a child of God?", "Answer": "The  behaviors  that  we  read  about  here-most  of  Proverbs  10-31  does  talk about  conduct-are  not  things  that  God  tells  you  to  do  in  order  to  become  his child. They are not things God tells you to do in order for him to love you. These behaviors are what the Lord is producing in those who are already his children- those  who  are  already  a  part  of  his  family.  He  is  slowly,  progressively conforming you to the image of Christ; he is making you more like Jesus Christ, who is the Wisdom of God. Proverbs is very much a book on sanctification. "}
{"Question": "Can you describe the progression of becoming more like Jesus as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "If  you  say,  \"I  don't  have  these  things  in  my  life.  My  life  is  a  wreck,\"  then maybe  the  reason  you  do  not  have  them  is  because  you  are  not  a  believer  in Jesus. I hope Proverbs 10 will reveal to you the areas of your life where you are a fool and sinful, and then will drive you to Jesus Christ as your Savior. Then, through faith in Christ, the wisdom of Proverbs is what God will produce in your life  daily.  The  gospel  is  not  about  making  yourself  righteous;  it  is  not  about doing  these  things  to  become  righteous.  The  gospel  is  about  how  the righteousness of Jesus has been credited to your account by virtue of your faith in him and how, by his Spirit and by his Word, he is molding you and shaping you to become more like him. It's a slow process. It is gradual. You can take two steps forward, one step or three steps back, then a few steps forward again. But it is a process whereby God is molding you and shaping you into the image of his Wisdom, who is Jesus Christ. "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of faith as described in the text differ from mere belief or conviction?", "Answer": "The Christian life is lived by faith. You live by faith recognizing your sin and foolishness, and then you daily repent of the areas where you are not believing the gospel or worshiping Jesus rightly. As you do that, the Lord shapes you into the image of Christ so that you can live out the wisdom of Proverbs. We are not saved by faith plus works, but we are saved by a faith that does work. Faith will produce obedience and wisdom in your life. "}
{"Question": "What pivotal role does Proverbs 9 play in the overall structure and flow of the book of Proverbs?", "Answer": "Proverbs 9 teaches us this truth. Proverbs teaches that when we fail to live up to  God's  wisdom  it  is  evidence  of  idols  in  our  hearts  that  we  are  worshiping rather than Jesus. It reveals a problem with Jesus in our lives. Proverbs 9 was the key  chapter-the  hinge  chapter-because  it  summed  up  everything  that  came before it (Prov 1-8) and it sets up everything that comes after it (Prov 10-31). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs suggest that daily activities can be viewed through a spiritual lens?", "Answer": "Proverbs  10-31  is  random  and  disconnected,  but  there  are  major  categories that you can look at thematically (as we will in this book). The major categories are  things  like  words,  work,  finances,  relationships,  and  future  rewards.  Since these things reveal whether we are in right relationship with Jesus or worshiping idols, what Proverbs shows us is that there is no spiritual and secular divide in life.  You  do  not  have  your  religious  life  over  here  and  your  secular  life  over there. Proverbs says all of the areas of your daily life are spiritual in nature. It does not matter how morally neutral the advice Solomon gives here may seem to be;  it  is  not  neutral.  These  practical  areas  of  your  life  either  show  you  are moving toward Jesus or you are moving away from Jesus. That has everything to do with whether or not you can clean your room, whether or not you have right relationships, and whether or not you can balance your checkbook. So we must read chapters 10-31 in this context. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 10 illustrate the contrast between the paths of wisdom and foolishness?", "Answer": "We will walk briefly through Proverbs 10 and some cross-reference verses in other  parts  of  Proverbs  to  see  examples  of  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs  so  we  can know how to read the whole book as a book about Jesus and our wisdom in him. Proverbs  10  mainly  contrasts  the  two  ways  or  paths  that  we  have  seen  so  far. There  is  a  way  of  wisdom  and  a  way  of  foolishness.  There  is  a  way  of (synonymous  with  wisdom)  and  a  way  of  wickedness righteousness  (synonymous  with  foolishness)  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  447).19  Solomon constantly contrasts these two paths in these major categories of life. We will see how that is laid out here and see that Proverbs 10-31 points us to how Jesus will produce this kind of wisdom progressively in his followers. "}
{"Question": "How does the Book of Proverbs present the relationship between wisdom and financial gain?", "Answer": "Proverbs says many things about money. Proverbs can be very positive. It says that  if  you  are  a  wise  person,  you  will  make  more  money,  generally  speaking. But  the  Proverbs  are  not  always  positive  about  money.  They  do  not  say  that every time you accumulate money you should take it as a sign of God's blessing in  your  life.21  Money-if  it  is  not  gotten  in  the  right  way  or  if  you  trust  in  it (11:28)-is destructive. I had a friend who in college worked for a company that would sell things to senior adults that senior adults really did not need. After a couple of weeks, the person felt extremely guilty for selling things to people that they did not need and talking them into spending money they did not have. Yet, the employer was pressuring for more and more sales. My friend considered the people  on  these  sales  calls  and  thought,  \"I'm  swindling  my  grandmother.\"  My friend quit the job. The Bible says that these wrong ways of getting money are destructive  and  harmful  to  you.  Other  examples  where  we  can  see  this  are  the Enron debacle and Ponzi schemes. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 10:4-5 emphasize the importance of a proactive work ethic?", "Answer": "Proverbs 10:4-5 turns to the issue of work ethic when it says, Idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring riches. The son who gathers during summer is prudent; the son who sleeps during harvest is disgraceful. "}
{"Question": "What practical lessons can be derived from the agricultural metaphors used in Proverbs 10:4-5?", "Answer": "Proverbs 10:4-5 turns to the issue of work ethic when it says, Idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring riches. The son who gathers during summer is prudent; the son who sleeps during harvest is disgraceful. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does laziness manifest in modern society, as described in the text?", "Answer": "Solomon  says  two  things:  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty  and  shaming  your parents,  while  diligence  and  hard  work  lead  to  riches  where  you  are  able  to provide  and  bring  joy  to  your  parents.  Again,  wisdom  is  about  the  effect  your actions  have  on  you  and  the  people  around  you.  The  problem  is  that  hardly anyone confesses that they are a lazy person. No one has ever walked into my office  for  counseling  and  said,  \"I'm  really  wrestling  with  laziness.\"  No  one thinks  they  are  lazy  because  the  picture  of  laziness  in  their  mind  is  the  couch potato who watches soap operas all day long while eating Klondike bars in their bathrobe. In Proverbs, laziness refers to people who cannot see their assignments through to completion (see Moore, \"Finding Jesus\"). They might start a task and get to the middle of it, but they walk away before it is finished. It's the son who helped  plant  the  crops  but  is  not  there  during  harvest  to  finish  the  task.  In  our day, the laziness of Proverbs looks like distractions that keep you from staying on task. You cannot complete your assignments because Facebook distracts you for thirty minutes. You come back and do five minutes of work, but then check Twitter for fifteen minutes. Laziness is seen in the extended adolescence of our culture where kids can't grow up and provide for themselves but keep ending up back  at  Mom  and  Dad's  house  (bringing  shame  to  their  parents,  even  if  the parents  won't  admit  it).  Laziness  keeps  you  from  providing  for  your  family  or from the ability to have a family, and the failure to provide for your family is a failure to believe the gospel-it's a Jesus problem (cf. 1 Tim 5:8). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 13:11 caution against the consequences of acquiring wealth hastily?", "Answer": "We see these same themes throughout the Proverbs. Proverbs 13:11 says in the ESV,  \"Wealth  gained  hastily  will  dwindle,  but  whoever  gathers  little  by  little will increase it.\" Murphy and Huwiler prefer that translation as well and writes, \"The  sense  is  that  when  money  comes  too  easily  for  a  person,  it  will  not  last\" (Proverbs,  65).  Proverbs  consistently  condemns  get-rich-quick  schemes  as disastrous.  We  can  sit  back  and  observe  that  this  is  truly  the  case.  How  many stories  have  you  heard  of  NFL  or  NBA  stars  who  made  millions  and  were bankrupt  before  they  hit  forty?  For  many,  they  gained  all  that  money  too quickly, without having formed the kind of wisdom that was necessary for them to know how to handle and steward that money well. That is true for us as well. We have to be shaped and molded with the kind of character it takes to be able to handle money rightly. That kind of wisdom typically comes by gaining money little by little. Jesus works in your life so that he who is faithful with a few things can now be given many things. "}
{"Question": "What role does self-centeredness play in the behavior described in the text?", "Answer": "Here is the point, and this is a major theme in Proverbs: If you are the kind of person  who  loves  to  hear  the  sound  of  your  own  voice  and  who  speaks  more than  you  listen,  then  you're  probably  a  fool.  You  are  probably  worshiping  the idol of self. "}
{"Question": "Can we infer from the text that active listening is a key component of wisdom?", "Answer": "Here is the point, and this is a major theme in Proverbs: If you are the kind of person  who  loves  to  hear  the  sound  of  your  own  voice  and  who  speaks  more than  you  listen,  then  you're  probably  a  fool.  You  are  probably  worshiping  the idol of self. "}
{"Question": "How can a person's inability to listen to others' advice lead to negative consequences?", "Answer": "How  many  of  you  know  people  who,  when  you  have  a  conversation  with them,  they  look  like  they  are  not  listening  to  a  word  you  are  saying  at  all  but rather are just waiting for you to take a breath so they can speak? They want to tell you their thoughts on things, but they do not want to hear your thoughts at all. Maybe you are that kind of person. If you are the kind of person who loves to talk and cannot receive commands or advice from others, then you are a fool and  it  will  end  up  hurting  you.  You  will  come  to  ruin.  Why?  Because  if  you cannot listen to someone else's instructions, you will never learn from your own mistakes. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs caution against the potential harm caused by excessive talk and sin?", "Answer": "We  see  this  theme  throughout  Proverbs.  Proverbs  13:3  says,  \"The  one  who guards  his  mouth  protects  his  life;  the  one  who  opens  his  lips  invites  his  own ruin.\" Proverbs repeatedly says that those who speak a lot also sin a lot and are destructive to themselves and the people around them. Since we are sinners, the more  we  talk,  sooner  or  later  something  stupid  will  come  out  of  our  mouths. How  many  times  have  you  said  something  and  immediately  wished  you  could take it back? But you can't! Jesus produces the ability to guard your tongue. "}
{"Question": "What character traits are associated with wisdom in the context of how one treats their neighbors?", "Answer": "Wisdom has to do with relationships. Whether you are the kind of person who loves your neighbor or makes fun of your neighbor reveals whether you are wise or  a  fool  (11:12).  Whether  you  are  the  kind  of  person  who  can  keep  secrets reveals whether you are wise or a fool (11:13). Are you the kind of person who is  told  something  in  confidence,  then  a  few  days  later  you  confide  in  another friend, \"Hey, I'm only telling you this and you can't tell anyone else, but did you know  that  .  .  .\"?  If  you  do  that,  you  are  an  idolatrous  fool.  Most  likely  the inability to keep secrets reveals that you worship yourself because you like to be the person who has and disseminates information. That has everything to do with your relationship with Jesus. "}
{"Question": "Can the text's stance on keeping secrets be seen as reflective of one's relationship with Jesus?", "Answer": "Wisdom has to do with relationships. Whether you are the kind of person who loves your neighbor or makes fun of your neighbor reveals whether you are wise or  a  fool  (11:12).  Whether  you  are  the  kind  of  person  who  can  keep  secrets reveals whether you are wise or a fool (11:13).

{"Question": "How does following Jesus lead to rewards, as explained in the text?", "Answer": "Following  Jesus  leads  to  rewards  in  this  life  and  in  the  one  to  come.  Proverbs 10-31 really boils down to conduct and the consequences that come out of that conduct.  Solomon  is  a  good  teacher.  Solomon  doesn't  just  tell  his  son  what  to do, he tells him why he should do it. Here is what will happen. If you are wise, here is the good that can result.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 12:28 tackle the concept of righteousness and its implications on mortality?", "Answer": "Throughout Proverbs 10 and following, these consequences are presented both as  present  and  future.  Proverbs  12:21  promises  stability  in  your  life  and  not chaos when you walk in wisdom, whereas 12:28 promises that the righteous will never die. The problem is, none of us are righteous; so this verse means hell for us. But in Christ we are counted righteous; and even though we might die, yet we  will  live  forever.  Faith  in  Jesus  leads  to  life  eternal  beginning  the  moment you put your trust in him. "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of Christ as our qualification impact our pursuit of wisdom?", "Answer": "Jesus has fulfilled in our place the perfection God demands. He was the truly wise and fully sanctified human on our behalf. Thus, as we struggle to become wise, we know that our failures do not disqualify us from life because Christ himself is our only qualification.

{"Question": "Can you identify examples of individuals who are portrayed as embracing falsehoods in the text?", "Answer": "Perhaps  we  could  adjust  the  Bible  a  bit,  as  we  too  often  want  to  do,  and describe the modern mindset this way: \"Father, forgive us, for we know not what we are doing-and please don't tell us. We won't listen!\" We too easily buy into lies. We too readily play the fool. We can easily see this foolishness in someone like Marilyn Manson, but we often do not see it in ourselves. We disobey God's Word  because  we  think  that  our  lives,  our  marriages,  our  money,  or  our parenting  situations  are  the  exception  to  God's  clear  teaching.

He does not listen, but he is quick to tell others what he thinks. Pride is alive and well in his soul. He is convinced  that  what  he  thinks  is  what  everyone  else  ought  to  think.  He  is  too clever and cute for his own good. God gave us two ears and one mouth; perhaps we would all be wise to listen twice as much as we talk.

{"Question": "What does James 3:8 suggest about the challenging nature of controlling one's speech?", "Answer": "When  you  go  to  the  doctor  for  your  check-up  he  or  she  always  looks  at  your tongue  because  it  is  an  indicator  of  your  physical  health.  God  says  that  you should listen to what flows from your tongue because it is an indicator of your spiritual  health.  Unfortunately,  apart  from  salvation  in  Jesus,  who  redeems  the total  person,  the  tongue  runs  wild  and  spews  all  sorts  of  poison  and  venom. James 3:8 says, \"No one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.\" Proverbs repeatedly speaks to the importance and power of the tongue, and it does so again in 18:4-8. Here the focus is specifically on the words that come bubbling out of the mouth of the fool. "}
{"Question": "What are the consequences of engaging with the words of a fool, as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "He Does Not See the Delight of His Words (18:4) This verse contrasts the words of the fool with the words of the wise. The idea is that the words of a wise man are a continuous supply of blessing and nourishing counsel  (Ross,  \"Proverbs,\"  1023).  Deep  waters  are  cool,  pure,  and  refreshing. They bless and do not curse. They build up; they do not tear down. They are like a  beautiful \"flowing  river\"  or a \"fountain of wisdom.\" A  contrast is implied: a fool's  words  are  stale,  possibly  bitter,  potentially  poisonous.  They  cater  to  the wicked (v. 5), stir up strife (v. 6), ruin lives (v. 7), and find a home with those who gossip (v. 8). There is no delight to be seen in the fool's words. "}

{"Question": "How does the portrayal of a fool's speech in the text contribute to their ongoing conflicts?", "Answer": "As you might expect, a fool values none of this wise counsel. Actually a fool, as verse 6 teaches, is really good at talking himself into trouble. \"A fool's lips lead to strife, and his mouth provokes a beating.\" The ESV says, \"A fool's lips walk into  a  fight,  and  his  mouth  invites  a  beating.\"  The  Message  paraphrases  it  quite colorfully:  \"The  words  of  a  fool  start  fights;  do  him  a  favor  and  gag  him\"  (cf. "}
{"Question": "What is the consequence of a fool's words, as depicted in Proverbs 18:7?", "Answer": "He Does Not See the Destruction in His Words (18:7) Verse  7  repeats  the  idea  of  verse  6,  but  it  advances  the  argument.  The  fool receives  a  beating  in  verse  6,  but  he  is  destroyed  in  verse  7  (Waltke,  Proverbs, Chapters  1-15,  73).  Solomon  tells  us,  \"A  fool's  mouth  is  his  devastation  [ESV, \"ruin\"; NIV, \"undoing\"], and his lips are a trap for his life.\" Words are powerful weapons,  and  sometimes  we  use  them  to  our  own  ruin  and  destruction.  The picture is of a man who lays a deadly trap and he does so for himself! And he does this with his own lips, his own words. The fool is the man who cannot keep his  mouth  shut  even  though  his  words  will  ruin  him;  they  will  wreck  his  life. There is a self-destructive nature to the words of a fool as he reaps what he has sown  (Gal  6:6-7).  Proverbs  10:14  reinforces  the  truth  of  his  verse:  \"The  wise store  up  knowledge,  but  the  mouth  of  the  fool  hastens  destruction.\"  Proverbs 12:13  adds,  \"By  rebellious  speech  an  evil  person  is  trapped,  but  a  righteous person escapes from trouble.\" "}
{"Question": "How is a fool's attitude towards job performance described in the text?", "Answer": "He Is Poor in His Performance A fool is lazy in doing his job, or \"slack in his work\" (ESV). He is content to do just enough to get by. A poor job performance review is of no concern as long as he keeps his job. He is not known as a hard worker and he does not care. He is not known as an honest worker and he does not care. He is not known as the guy who  gives  110  percent  and  he  does  not  care.  He  is  not  known  as  the  guy  who will go the extra mile and he does not care. Colossians 3:23-24 calls the devoted follower  of  King  Jesus  to  a  different  and  higher  mindset  when  it  comes  to  our work. There Paul writes, "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Jesus embody the wisdom of God, as stated in 1 Corinthians 1:30?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus Christ is the quintessential Proverbs man, the embodiment of the Wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:30). He is also the antithesis of the fool in 18:1-9. The fool lacks wisdom, but Jesus is full of grace and truth ( John 1:14). Jesus was not isolated but surrounded himself with friends and companions with whom he shared life. He  was  not  opinionated  but  spoke  words  of  truth,  healing,  and  grace.  As  John 7:46  says,  \"No  man  ever  spoke  like  this!\"  It  must  be  admitted  that  he  was humiliated,  but  his  humiliation  was  for  the  benefit  of  others  as  \"he  humbled himself  by  becoming  obedient  to  the  point  of  death-even  death  on  a  cross\" (Phil  2:8).  He  was  dishonored  and  disgraced  so  that  we  would  not  have  to  be. And slack in his work? Not a chance. Not a hint. John 4:34 nails it: \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.\" Praise God, Jesus did finish the work the Father gave him and declared it to be so in John 19:30 when he said, \"It is finished.\" The Wisdom of God, the Lord Jesus, makes it possible for us to walk in wisdom and to not play the fool. His invitation is to all. How you will respond is up to you. "}

{"Question": "In what ways does the Bible emphasize God's foreknowledge and ultimate authority over events?", "Answer": "S ometimes  the  Word  of  God  is  difficult  to  swallow.  The  Bible  is  clear  that God  is  supremely  sovereign  and  in  control  of  all  things.  He  knows everything  before  it  happens.  He  declares  the  end  from  the  beginning  (Isa 46:10).  Nothing  surprises  him.  But  God's  sovereignty  means  more  than  that. God does whatever he wants (Ps 115:3). Whatever God wants to happen is what will happen. These things are not difficult to understand, but they can be really difficult to accept. They can really challenge our faith. "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of God's sovereignty challenge the traditional notion of absolute free will?", "Answer": "The concept of God's sovereignty makes us uncomfortable because \"I've got free  will,  and  God  can't  infringe  on  my  choices,  otherwise  it's  not  free  will.\" Well, yes, you do have free will, and no, you really don't. There is no such thing as absolute free will. There are two biblical reasons we understand that our free will is not absolute, that we cannot do anything we want to do. First, your will is constrained by your nature. You can only make choices in accordance with your nature. For example, I'm free to dunk a basketball, but I ( Jon) cannot because I lack  the  ability  in  my  nature.  Since  you  are  a  sinner  by  nature,  you  cannot choose not to sin. It is inevitable that you will sin, regardless of how much you might not want to sin. While we might have the natural ability to make certain choices, our sin nature constricts us morally from actually doing it. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 21:1 exemplify the belief that God has the power to influence human free will?", "Answer": "Second,  the  Bible  teaches  that  God  can  and  does  override  human  free  will when he so desires. Proverbs 21:1 says, \"A king's heart is like channeled water in  the  LORD's  hand:  he  directs  it  wherever  he  chooses.\"  God  looks  at  a  human king and says, I can turn you whichever direction I want to turn you. We see an example  of  this  in  Genesis  20  when  Abraham  goes  to  Gerar,  where  King Abimelech reigns. As Abraham was prone to do, he lied about his wife Sarai and said she was his sister. He was fearful that the men of that region would try to kill  him  and  take  beautiful  Sarai  as  their  wife.  King  Abimelech  likes  what  he sees, and so he takes Sarai to be part of his harem of wives. But God comes to Abimelech in a dream and says he is a dead man because he is about to commit adultery with another man's wife. Abimelech objects that he did not know that. And God says this: \"Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. I have also  kept  you  from  sinning  against  me.  Therefore  I  have  not  let  you  touch  her\"  (Gen  20:6; emphasis  mine).  Abimelech  certainly  wanted  to  touch  her,  but  God  would  not allow him. God can override the will of a human king, and he certainly can do that  with  us.  God  can prevent  you  from  doing certain  things.  He  can keep  you from sinning. "}
{"Question": "How does Solomon create a cohesive and interconnected argument throughout Proverbs 16:1-15?", "Answer": "Proverbs  16:1-15  is  one  of  those  rare  texts  in  Proverbs  10-31  that  is  a  unit, where Solomon is making a sustained argument, rather than a random collection of  verses  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  5-6).  The  passage  is  a  unified  whole because  thematically  it  speaks  of  God's  sovereignty,  man's  responsibility,  and God's sovereign rule on earth through the Messiah, symbolized here by a \"king.\" And we know it is a unity because of key catchwords: detestable (both in reference to Yahweh and the Messiah; vv. 5,12),  wicked (those who come against Yahweh and  the  Messiah;  vv.  4,12),  and  atone  or  appease  (vv.  6,14).  These  words  link verses  1-9  about  Yahweh  with  verses  10-15  about  the  Messiah.  God  exercises his sovereign rule on earth through the Messiah. "}
{"Question": "How do the teachings from Proverbs challenge our conventional views on success and responsibility?", "Answer": "God is sovereign over every aspect of our lives, including our free actions and choices. He is sovereign over the areas we think we control. Proverbs 16:1 says, \"The reflections [or the plans] of the heart belong to mankind, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.\" That means we make plans, but God's will is what determines  if  they  succeed,  not  our  ingenuity  (Murphy  and  Hurwiler,  Proverbs, 79).  Yes,  we  are  responsible  to  plan  and  make  wise  decisions,  but  God  is  the final determiner of whether they succeed or fail. Verse 3 says this reality should cause humble dependence on him: \"Commit your activities [ESV, \"work\"] to the LORD,  and  your  plans  will  be  established.\"  God's  sovereignty  is  meant  to diminish our pride, so the right response is to lean on him. These verses do not discourage  planning  or  decision-making  at  all,  but  they  do  make  us  humbly aware  of  God's  role  in  the  final  outcome  (Longman,  Proverbs,  328).  The  result belongs  to  God,  not  to  you.  So  we  don't  say,  \"Look  what  I  did,\"  but  rather, \"Look what God did.\" God is the one who oversees all of this. "}
{"Question": "What reassurance does the text offer about relinquishing control over one's life to God?", "Answer": "These verses mean you should not go about doing your own work and making your own plans and then pray and ask God to make them successful (Longman, Proverbs,  328).  Rather,  you  pray  beforehand  and  allow  God's  Word  to  be  the supreme guide  as  you  make your plans.  Then you work hard to do your  work, submitting all of it to the Lord. Do not be paralyzed in fear forever. Act. Plan. Work. Trust. Depend. Submit. Recognize that even if your plans do not work out as you had hoped, God can use what happened for a deeper, better plan in your life that you may not see. Live in peace, recognizing that God is in control and you  can  sleep  at  night.  We  really  misunderstand  the  Bible  if  the  doctrine  of God's sovereignty makes us scared and uncomfortable. It is meant to be a soft pillow  at  night.  God  has  got  this!  You  are  not  in  control  of  your  life,  so  stop fretting like you are. After all, as we sang in VBS, \"He's got the whole world in his hands.\" "}
{"Question": "How is the idea that God's plan cannot be thwarted a source of assurance for believers?", "Answer": "Also, these verses teach that people's wickedness does not frustrate or thwart the  plan  of  God.  That's  also  good  news!  He  actually  uses  their  evil  to accomplish his plan. No one can stop God's plan from coming to fruition. God can  even  use  the  wickedness  of  evil  men  crucifying  the  Son  of  God  to sovereignly accomplish his purpose of saving the world. "}
{"Question": "How do sin, Satan, and death function as enemies within the context of the new covenant salvation?", "Answer": "We know that atonement leads to being made more like Jesus because the end of verse 6, after atonement has been made, references the fear of the Lord and turning  away  from  evil.  After  you  are  saved  by  the  atonement,  you  are  then made wise and holy through fear of the Lord-dependence on him. Verse 7 says that  salvation  includes  the  defeat  of  your  enemies.  In  the  new  covenant  our enemies  are  not  flesh  and  blood  but  rather  sin,  Satan,  and  death.  Jesus  has defeated them all in his death and resurrection, and we get to share in that. God's sovereignty is good news because it means that he saves us from our sin, makes us wise (see Rom 8:28-29), and defeats our enemies. "}

{"Question": "How does the concept of God's sovereignty provide reassurance in times of suffering and chaos?", "Answer": "God's sovereignty is good news because it means he can take evil and use it for good. His sovereignty means that the suffering and chaos in your life is not meaningless or ultimate. You may not see how in the world what is happening to you could ever be a good thing, and you may never understand it until eternity, but you can trust that a God who did not remain distant from your suffering-but rather entered into your world, suffered even beyond what you are suffering, and died in your place-has a good reason and plan for why he is allowing all these things  to  happen  in  your  life.  Plus,  one  day  he  will  do  away  with  evil  and suffering forever. Revelation 21-22 is on the way! "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 16:9 emphasize the interplay between human agency and divine intervention?", "Answer": "Proverbs 16:9 ends this section on God's sovereignty by saying, \"A person's heart plans his way, but the LORD determines his steps.\" Verse 9 caps Solomon's argument with a final statement on God's ultimate sovereignty. We make plans, but God orders our steps. He ordains all things. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 16:10-15 depict the ideal king's role as a vice-regent of God on earth?", "Answer": "Proverbs  16:10-15  gives  the  picture  of  the  ideal,  messianic  king  who  rules  as God's  vice-regent  on  earth  (see  Waltke's  great  discussion  on  this  in  Proverbs, Chapters  15-31,  16-22).  The  word  \"king\"  is  prominent,  appearing  in  every  verse but verse 11 ( just as God appeared in every verse in 1-9 except 8). These verses are  deliberately  paired  with  the  sovereignty  of  God  in  verses  1-9  to  show  that Messiah's reign mirrors the sovereign reign of God. "}
{"Question": "How is God's sovereignty depicted in the Old Testament in relation to the human king?", "Answer": "In the Old Testament, God's sovereignty is mediated to the people through the human king. Let's walk through this description and see God's rule through the Messiah.  Verse  10  says  that  God's  verdict  is  on  the  king's  lips  so  that  he  can make infallible judgments. When the king judges, he judges rightly. He does not do anything that is unjust. When he judges, he literally speaks for God.

{"Question": "Why is it considered unwise to resist or oppose God's plan as mentioned in the text?", "Answer": "Conclusion Our response to the sovereign Lord and his Messiah is to bow the knee. Why? We bow to the King because God's sovereign plan for the world is centered on the Messiah. God's sovereign plan is to exalt the Son and through him to redeem persons from every people group on earth (see Rev 5; 7). God's plan will not be stopped,  so  do  not  take  a  stand  against  it.  Rather,  embrace  it.  It  is  foolish  to attempt to live outside the sovereignty of God. Submit to the King! Anyone who repents of sin and believes in Jesus will be saved and be part of God's plan for the  world.  For  some  of  you  this  may  be  scary,  or  you  might  have  a  hard  time agreeing with it, but deep in your heart you believe this and are comforted by it. After  all,  we  sing  about  this  all  the  time:  \"He's  got  the  whole  world  in  his hands,\"  and  \"From  life's  first  cry  to  final  breath,  Jesus  commands  my  destiny.

{"Question": "What alternative interpretation of Proverbs 22:6 is suggested in the text?", "Answer": "This Verse Is a Warning to Correct Your Children There  is  a  different  way  to  understand  Proverbs  22:6  that  we  have  found extremely helpful. Instead of being a promise that if you do right, your children will turn out right, it is a reverse promise-a warning-that if you do not correct your children when they are young, they will run amok wanting their own way as an adult. "}
{"Question": "What does Proverbs emphasize as the consequences of following one's own heart or \"way\"?", "Answer": "The  clear  warning  of  the  Proverbs-despite  the  messaging  we  receive  from Disney  movies-is  that  following  your  own  heart  or  your  own  \"way\"  is  the epitome  of  foolishness.  Doing  what  is  right  in  your  own  eyes  leads  to  death (14:12).  Proverbs  teaches  that  God  gives  young  people  to  parents  who  are supposed  to  correct  this  condition.  You  see,  the  best  interpretation  of  Proverbs 22:6 is sort of sarcastic: Let a child have his way when he is young, and when he is  old,  he  will  continue  to  insist  on  having  his  way  (Clifford,  Proverbs,  197).  In other  words,  if  you  start  by  letting  a  young  person  have  his  own  way,  he  will continue  on  that  dead-end  road  when  he  grows  up.  Thus,  this  verse  is  the  flip side  of  a  promise;  it  is  a  warning  that  parents  must  correct  their  children's foolish character before it is set. Children left to their own devices will destroy themselves. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 29:15 suggest that the forms of discipline for children evolve over time?", "Answer": "Proverbs  29:15  implies  that  directing  and  correcting  your  children  will  take different forms over time: spanking (\"a rod\") and reproof (not leaving a youth to himself).  Spanking  can  be  the  only  way  to  get  through  to  a  young  child sometimes  because  all  the  reasoning  in  the  world  will  not  help.  An  ancient Egyptian  proverb  said  of  young  boys  that  they  have  ears  on  their  backsides (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 1-15, 574). A study at Calvin College actually shows that kids spanked between the ages of two and six earned better grades in school and had a sunnier outlook on life (Black, \"Spanking Makes Kids Better\"). There is no room for physical abuse of children, but the Bible is also clear that a lack of discipline is a way to abuse your children. However, a verbal reprimand almost always  works  better  as  children  age,  and  they  should  be  able  to  heed  a  verbal rebuke as they grow in maturity. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 22:6 challenge the notion of permissive parenting in modern times?", "Answer": "Proverbs 22:6 moves against the buddy-parent philosophy of so many. If you allow your child to be self-centered now, they will be later (and no one will like them!). You have to say no sometimes. Many times! Do not turn your child into a brat like Veruca Salt from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, who always gets her way  but  is  a  miserable  person.  If  you  let  your  children  have  their  way  without correction, it will be hurtful to them and to you. "}
{"Question": "Why is it suggested to react to a child's use of bad words with laughter rather than reprimand?", "Answer": "2.  When he picks up bad words, laugh at him.

{"Question": "How might the avoidance of certain language influence an individual's perception of societal norms?", "Answer": "4.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs connect discipline with evangelism in the context of parenting?", "Answer": "This Verse Tells Us Our Children's Greatest Need Is the Good News about Jesus Proverbs  22:6  ultimately  demonstrates  that  our  children's  greatest  need  is  the good  news  about  Jesus.  Our  role  is  not  simply  behavior  modification  that  will turn our children into Pharisees, or into rebels when the bribes for good behavior and  threats  toward  bad  behavior  go  away.  No,  our  goal  for  our  children  is  life transformation  through  Jesus.  Proverbs  is  clear  that  discipline  is  evangelism: \"Don't withhold discipline from a youth; if you punish him with a rod, he will not die. Punish him with a rod, and you will rescue his life from Sheol\" (23:13- 14). "}
{"Question": "How does the act of disciplining children relate to the concept of rescue mentioned in the text?", "Answer": "Discipline is a rescue mission. We are to step in to rescue our kids from hell and  the  path  that  leads  there.  If  we  do  not  correct  our  children,  they  will  not recognize their sin or that they will be held accountable. Some Christian parents misunderstand grace as calling for a laissez-faire attitude toward discipline, but that is deadly. Loving discipline shows our children that there are consequences and accountability for sinful actions, and it demonstrates that there is a standard of  right  and  wrong-one  that  they  have  fallen  short  of,  and  thus  they  need  a Savior.

Wisdom is the discernment to read the person or the situation  and  know  if  that  is  the  case.  How  do  you  know  if  you  should  not correct or answer someone? If your answer to them will require stooping to their level, avoid answering them.26 If your answer or attempt at correction will do no good,  if  it  will  drain  your  energy  and  not  get  anyone  anywhere,  it's  best  to remain quiet (Longman, Proverbs, 212).

{"Question": "How can one maintain focus on Jesus during a conversation, as suggested in the text?", "Answer": "There  are  some  people  you  should  not  answer,  correct,  or  engage  in conversation.  Do  not  play  her  game  or  play  by  his  rules.  If  you  are  going  to answer  them,  change  up  the  rules!  For  example,  when  doing  evangelism,  you need to recognize comments or questions that will sidetrack the conversation and do  your  best  to  bypass  them.  Someone  says,  \"Well,  a  thousand  years  ago Christians killed people in the Crusades; why would I want to be a Christian?\" I could spend a lot of time answering that and get off track. Or I could kindly say, \"Why don't we discuss that another day and right now keep the focus on what Jesus did?\" Keep the focus on Jesus, not objections about obscure manuscripts, battles  that  took  place  a  millennia  ago,  or  why  there  are  so  many  different denominations.

{"Question": "Can discernment be seen as a key component in embodying the characteristics of Jesus?", "Answer": "Proverbs has taught us that Wisdom is not a thing; Wisdom is a person-Jesus of  Nazareth.  So  growth  in  him  does  not  just  mean  growth  in  not  sinning  as much, although it does include that (Moore, Walking the Line). It also means growth in discernment! You begin to know whether answering will get you nowhere or will  help  the  person  or  others  around  them.  This  is  what  growing  in Christlikeness  looks  like.  You  are  able  to  perceive  motivations  and  outcomes. You are able to let things go and remain silent when you should. You are able to be bold and speak up when you should. "}

{"Question": "How does the account in Matthew 15:1-9 demonstrate Jesus's response to the Pharisees' actions?", "Answer": "For  example,  in  Matthew  15:1-9  the  Pharisees  challenged  Jesus  because  his disciples  did  not  follow  the  rules  for  hand  washing.  Jesus  turned  around  and swatted them for using their rules to justify not honoring their moms and dads. He revealed their hypocrisy so that they would not be wise in their own eyes or the eyes of the crowd. In Matthew 16 Peter foolishly rebuked Jesus concerning the  cross,  and  Jesus  answered  him  rather  directly  to  correct  his  folly,  \"Get behind  me,  Satan!\"  (v.  23).  What  Peter  was  saying  was  satanic,  so  Jesus corrected him. "}
{"Question": "How did the chief priests react when Jesus redirected the conversation towards John's baptism?", "Answer": "Jesus  also  knew  when  to  not  play  people's  games.  The  chief  priests  tried  to challenge  Jesus's  authority  in  the  temple  by  asking  by  what  authority  he  did what  he  did.  Jesus  knew  their  game,  so  he  asked  a  follow-up  question  about John's  baptism  that  the  priests  refused  to  answer.  He  refused  to  answer  fools according  to  their  folly.  Matthew  21:27  says,  \"So  they  answered  Jesus,  â€˜We don't know.' And he said to them, â€˜Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'\" He refused to play their game. "}
{"Question": "How did Jon's lack of mechanical skills prove to be a challenge when he started having children?", "Answer": "M y ( Jon's) dad taught me and instilled many things in me, but how to fix things was definitely not one of them. He is mechanically challenged. Not having that skill in my own life did not prove to be a problem until Ashley and I started  having  children.

He and I put together all  kinds  of  things  like  cribs,  rockers,  and  swing  sets.  Inevitably  what  would happen is that, even though Jimmy is good at putting things together, we would rush into the project, put it together, and then notice that we had made a mistake somewhere along the way. For example, we put a sofa table together, and when we  finished  we  noticed  the  legs  of  the  table  were  facing  outward  rather  than inward like they were supposed to. At that point, we had to go back and actually look  at  the  instructions  for  the  first  time,  see  where  we  went  wrong,  and  start again the right way.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 30 illustrate the concept of wisdom as a skill for navigating life's patterns?", "Answer": "Proverbs  30  gets  at  this  kind  of  thing  in  the  grand  scheme  of  life  when  it comes  to  wisdom  and  your  way  in  the  world.  There  is  a  pattern  to  the  world. There is a certain way that it works, and you need to live according to the pattern because  that's  wise.  Wisdom  is  the  skill  to  live  according  to  that  pattern.  To understand what that skill is, you have to go the Maker-the one who created the world-to see how the world works. That is what Proverbs 30 is all about, and it shows us three important truths. "}
{"Question": "How does the anonymity of the author and the recipients impact the interpretation of the text?", "Answer": "The author of this passage is Agur the son of Jakeh (v. 1). We do not know who Agur is because this is the only place he is mentioned in the Bible. Some do not take this as a proper name but rather interpret the meaning of the names as \"I am a  sojourner  (Agur)  and  son  of  Yahweh  the  Holy  (  Jakeh)\"  since  Jakeh  is shorthand for \"Yahweh the Holy\" (see Skehan, Studies, 27-45). That is a possible interpretation. Regardless, the author is a follower of the one true God. Not only do we not know exactly who Agur is, but we also do not know the recipients to whom he is writing: Ithiel and Ucal.28 What we do know is that the Holy Spirit of God breathed out these words for us. "}
{"Question": "How does Agur's admission of ignorance set the stage for his pursuit of wisdom?", "Answer": "Agur starts the passage in verses 2-3 by claiming to be ignorant: I am more stupid than any other person, and I lack a human's ability to understand. I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One. He  confesses  that  he  is  limited  when  it  comes  to  wisdom.  But  Proverbs repeatedly  indicates  that  humility  is  the  first  step  to  wisdom.  To  become  wise, you need to recognize that you are not and look to God for it. "}
{"Question": "What does the reference to Jesus as the Son of man imply in the context of access to divine wisdom?", "Answer": "Agur's question in verse 4 is answered directly in Jesus's reply to Nicodemus in John 3:13, \"No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven-the Son of man.\" (Tree of Life, 186) The  point  is  that  God's  Son  is  the  one  who  has  access  to  God's  wisdom because he came from heaven, so look to God and his Son for wisdom. "}
{"Question": "What significance does the purity of every word of God hold, as indicated in verses 5-6?", "Answer": "How do you do that? I think verses 5-6 give us the answer: Every word of God is pure; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Don't add to his words, or he will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar. "}

{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs 30 caution against the pitfalls of wealth and self-sufficiency?", "Answer": "Agur pleads with the Lord to feed him with the food that he needs. Give me my daily bread. Let me have just enough for my needs to be met. Help me to be content  with  that  and  not  greedy  for  more.  Why?  He  gives  the  reasons  for  his supplication. First, if he has too much, he will deny the Lord (v. 9). After all, the reason God gave Israel daily manna from heaven in the wilderness was to teach them to depend on him and not on financial provision. He wanted them to learn that  man  lives  by  the  word  of  God,  not  by  bread.  In  Deuteronomy  8  God  says that the purpose of the manna in the wilderness was that Israel was about to enter a land flowing with milk and honey, and when they got to that abundance they were  going  to  forget  God  and  think  they  did  this  on  their  own.  That  is  what Proverbs  30  is  warning  us  about.  If  you  have  too  much,  you  won't  depend  on God. It's not saying that all rich people are greedy or profaners, but it is saying that wealth is so deceptive that it is hard for the rich to recognize their need of God. "}
{"Question": "How does Agur's prayer signify a shift towards complete reliance on God for guidance and support?", "Answer": "The point is that both riches and poverty can lead to a lack of dependence on God.  If  you  are  rich,  you  think  you  do  not  need  God  because  you  can  do  this yourself. And if you are poor, you think obviously God isn't helping you so you need to do this yourself. Agur asks God to give him the kind of life where he can learn  to  depend  on  and  praise  God's  name  the  best-the  way  of  contentment. The motivation for his prayer is not his own needs; the motivation for his prayer is the name of God! God, glorify yourself by teaching me to lean wholly on you. "}
{"Question": "How does Agur establish the theme of judgment and sin in the section discussed?", "Answer": "In  fact,  judgment  of  sin  governs  this  whole  section.  Agur  describes  in  this section behavior that deserves condemnation. So verse 10 sets up the listing of verses  11-14  and  gives  us  a  key  for  how  to  interpret  them.  In  verses  11-14  he gives  four  \"generations\"  or  types  of  sinners  who  will  be  condemned  by  God (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 146). "}
{"Question": "What significance does verse 10 hold in relation to interpreting the subsequent verses 11-14?", "Answer": "In  fact,  judgment  of  sin  governs  this  whole  section.

{"Question": "What actions exemplify behavior that is condemned before God regarding treatment of parents?", "Answer": "First,  there  is  a  generation  that  curses  instead  of  blessing  its  parents  (v.  11). The Bart Simpsons of the world who are smart-alecks to their parents; the angst- ridden  teens  who  yell  at  their  parents,  \"I  hate  you!\";  the  bratty  three-year-old who shouts \"No!\" to his parents' directions; or even the grown child who refuses to  provide  care  for  aging  parents.  I  (  Jon)  remember  when  I  pastored  in Louisville,  we  were  hit  with  a  huge  ice  storm  one  winter  that  left  thousands without power. We received a call from the grown daughter of one of our elderly members  who  was  worried  about  her  parents  and  wanted  the  church  to  take bread and milk to them and make sure that they were OK. We were happy to do so. The problem was that this grown-and fully healthy-daughter lived in the same  town  as  her  parents  and  she  did  not  lift  a  finger  to  help  them  herself. Proverbs says this sort of behavior is condemned before God. The behavior that honors  God  is  what  Christ  displayed-obeying  his  parents  in  childhood  (Luke 2:51) and caring for his aging mother as he died ( John 19:26-27). "}
{"Question": "What recurring warnings or advice does Proverbs offer regarding the dangers of pride?", "Answer": "Third,  there  is  a  prideful  generation  (v.  13).  You  can  see  it  in  their  eyes! Again, the temptation to think more highly of yourself than you ought is a strong one. Pride is almost the essence of foolishness in Proverbs. Proverbs repeatedly condemns it as the path to death. "}
{"Question": "What is the consequence outlined in Proverbs 30:17 for those who disrespect their parents?", "Answer": "Proverbs 30:17 gives us the outcome for these generations, specifically those who curse parents, but it applies to all: \"As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.\"30 This outcome is the end for those who roll their eyes at their parents.  Judgment  will  fall  on  these  generations,  and  it  is  described  in  the grossest  of  ways.  The  language  of  being  eaten  by  vultures  outside  the  camp  is the sign of someone who is accursed. God's judgment is described sometimes as being eaten by birds (Rev 19:17-18). "}
{"Question": "How does the imagery of being eaten by vultures in Proverbs serve as a symbol of divine judgment?", "Answer": "Proverbs 30:17 gives us the outcome for these generations, specifically those who curse parents, but it applies to all: \"As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.\"30 This outcome is the end for those who roll their eyes at their parents.

{"Question": "What curse did Jesus bear on behalf of all individuals, as referenced in Gal 3?", "Answer": "The good news is that Jesus took this curse for us (Gal 3). The entire curse that we  deserve  for  not  honoring  our  parents,  for  our  self-righteousness,  for  our arrogance, and for our indifference to the poor crushed Jesus on the cross in our place. He was taken outside the camp, executed under the judgment of God, and then  raised  from  the  dead  in  vindication  so  all  who  believe  in  him  will  be declared right before God! So look to Jesus for salvation from your sins. "}
{"Question": "What analogy does Agur use to illustrate the discreet nature of moving objects in verses 18-20?", "Answer": "Next,  he  warns  about  uncontrolled  appetites  for  sex  in  verses  18-20.  What Agur  observes  here  are  things  that  move  on  or  in  something  else,  but  what moves does not leave any trace of itself behind.31 They do not leave any tracks. An eagle does not leave a path in the sky, a serpent leaves no trail on a rock, and the  waves  behind  the  ship  settle  so  no  one  ever  knows  it  was  there.  The  other three observations about things that move on or in something without leaving a trace  serve  the  final,  human  observation:  the  way  of  a  man  \"with\"  (though  the best translation like the other three is \"in\") a virgin or a young woman. This is talking of the proper context of sexual relations between a man and a woman in marriage.

{"Question": "How does Agur utilize observations of animals to impart wisdom about skillful living?", "Answer": "Instruction in Wisdom Not  only  does  Agur  observe  the  world  and  warn  about  uncontrolled  appetites, but  second,  he  moves  on  to  observations  that  instruct  us  in  skillful  living.  He observes  four  small  but  wise  animals  in  verses  24-28  and  then  more  stately animals in verses 29-31. You learn wisdom by observing these animals. Again, wisdom is not IQ; it's skill for life. None of these animals could take an IQ test, but they instruct us in wisdom because they have the ability to navigate through life despite the limitations they have (Longman, Proverbs, 532). So observe these animals and do likewise. "}
{"Question": "How do proponents of gender equality argue for a genderless androgynous concept of manhood?", "Answer": "W hen  it  comes  to  the  topic  of  what  it  really  means  to  be  a  man,  we  are fighting  against  cultural  errors,  even  in  the  Christian  subculture.  Some people  erroneously  think  manhood  means  machismo.  They  think  a  real  man loves UFC, beer guzzling, conquests, and bravado. Others think manhood does not really matter. They would rather talk about personhood. A real man can be a kind of genderless androgyne because the sexes are equal not only in essence but also in function. "}
{"Question": "What distinction does the text draw between being a \"real man\" and being a \"godly man\"?", "Answer": "We have no real shot at being real men. After all, what does that even mean? You might even ask, \"Shouldn't we want to be godly men instead of real men?\" Those  two  are  the  same  thing.  Being  a  real  man  means  being  the  man  God intended you to be both by creation and by redemption. Obviously we have all fallen miserably short of God's design. But, thank God, one man did not-Jesus. "}

{"Question": "What message or lesson can men derive from the reference to Adam's passivity in the text?", "Answer": "Real  men  love  their  children  by  disciplining  them  and  attempting  to  rescue them from hell.

Too many men do. You need to lovingly correct your children so they know the right path. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs define a 'real man' in terms of self-control and discipline?", "Answer": "A Real Man Loves Discipline One of the main teachings of Proverbs is that real men know how to control their appetites  for  sex,  money,  power,  status,  food,  and  alcohol.  A  real  man  is  self- controlled!  Proverbs  25:28  says,  \"A  person  who  does  not  control  his  temper  is like a city whose wall is broken down.\" A city like that is vulnerable to any kind of attack (Garrett,  Proverbs, 211). The devil loves to prey on men who are weak like  this.  He  has  destroyed  many  men  through  their  appetites.  In  contrast,  the Spirit of Jesus produces self-control in your life (Gal 5:22-23). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs define the relationship between pride and discipline in men?", "Answer": "Real  men  are  disciplined  when  it  comes  to  pride.  They  know  how  to  be humble  because  God  gives  grace  to  the  humble  (Prov  3:34).  Men  have  an appetite,  according  to  Proverbs,  to  always  be  right  in  their  own  eyes.  Men  are often headstrong. The prideful fool is right in his own eyes and will not listen to what  other  people  have  to  say  (12:15).  The  antidote  is  to  trust  the  Lord  and receive wise counsel from him and others! "}

{"Question": "In what ways do real men demonstrate a prioritization of God's opinion over the opinions of others?", "Answer": "Finally, real men are not controlled by what others think about them.

And God actively curses the foolish family with sorrow by handing them over to what they want. So let's look  to  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs  and  see  the  path  to  a  happy  home.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs provide a nuanced perspective on the role of money in one's life?", "Answer": "Both  options  could  be  true-wisdom  is  the  path  to  a  loving  family  and legitimate  wealth.  After  all,  Proverbs  gives  a  balanced  view  of  money.  It  does not give an unqualified endorsement of money; rather, it says both positive and negative things about money. Money gained through wisdom is good. According to Proverbs, it is good to be content, to be generous, to provide for your family, to save, and to leave an inheritance. On the other hand, money can become an idol  that  costs  you  your  family.  Money  is  only  good  in  the  proper  context  of contentedly enjoying it in a happy family! Proverbs says that if the choice you have is between a happy home and a wealthy home, choose a happy home every day  of  the  week  (Longman,  Proverbs,  318).  A  happy,  loving  home  rooted  in biblical wisdom is much better than a wealthy home with tension! "}

{"Question": "How does the anecdote shared by Jon emphasize the importance of balancing work and family time?", "Answer": "The  application  seems  clear:  spend  more  energy  loving  your  children  and spending  time  with  them  than  making  money  for  them.  I  (  Jon)  remember counseling  with  a  young  husband  and  father  who  was  about  to  lose  his  family because  he  worked  all  the  time.  His  statement  to  me  was,  \"Well,  I  make  the money and she raises the kids.\" I think many men have that mindset. Yes, you are  called  to  provide  (1  Tim  5:8)  but  not  at  the  expense  of  the  parenting  task. Your  children  need  you.  They  need  two  parents.  I  have  never  counseled  with anyone who says, \"I was miserable as a child because my parents spent way too much  time  with  me.\"  But  I  have  counseled  the  opposite  many  times.  So  make quality time for your children. Go to their games and recitals, help bathe them, read  the  Bible  and  say  prayers  before  bed,  talk  with  them  throughout  the  day, and be an active part of their lives. I am so thankful for a father who modeled this for me and made sure to put our ball games on his calendar so he would not miss them. He built a happy home! "}

{"Question": "How does leading by example influence children's perception of a parent's faith and wisdom?", "Answer": "Example (14:26) It starts with your example. Your children need to see a saved parent who walks in wisdom. Psalms 127 and 128 echo these important themes we see in Proverbs. Your children need to see you pray, read Scripture, attend church, sing the songs with a good attitude, listen to the sermons, and serve in the church. In the home, they need to see that you have a hard work ethic, but they also need to see you prioritize time with them and your spouse. They need to see you love well your spouse. "}

{"Question": "How does Solomon emphasize the role of understanding consequences in teaching wisdom to children?", "Answer": "Do not just teach your children what to do; teach them why they must do it. The \"why\" is the motivation for the behavior. Solomon constantly tells his son the consequences or benefits of walking in wisdom or walking in folly. He says if  you  do  not  do  this  or  you  do  not  listen  to  that,  there  are  disastrous  results. Teach  your  children  why  they  should  do  their  chores,  handle  money  correctly, control  their  tongues,  and  develop  conflict  resolution  and  wise  planning  skills. Lay out both the benefits and the consequences. Teach them why it is a bad idea to buck authority, be too lazy to do their homework, be cocky, gossip, or have sex before marriage. "}

{"Question": "What methods does Proverbs advocate for correcting children's behavior?", "Answer": "How  do  you  correct  them?  Well,  Proverbs  clearly  calls  for  spanking.  If  that upsets you, send your e-mails to Solomon not us because it is all over Proverbs, no matter how out of step with the culture it might seem. We all understand this principle when it comes to working out. You discipline your body-introducing a little pain-in order to make it healthier. The same is true with spanking. It is not detrimental if done properly. In fact there are studies that show adults who were spanked as children have a sunnier outlook on life and are more successful (Baklinski, \"Young Children\"). You should never spank out of anger or because the  child  simply  is  not  doing  what  you  want  them  to  do-that's  called  abuse. You  should  not  spank  for  childish  accidents  like  spilling  milk.  But  you  should spank for outright defiance, dishonesty, or rebellion. Do it in private so as not to embarrass your child and so you can talk-have a teachable moment. "}
{"Question": "How can a gospel conversation be utilized as a tool for imparting understanding of right and wrong?", "Answer": "This is an  important  moment for  a gospel conversation.  Tell them what  they did  or  did  not  do.  Secure  an  acknowledgement  that  they  know  why  they  are getting a spanking. That can teach them confession. Tell them you love them no matter  what,  and  that  your  love  for  them  is  not  determined  by  their  behavior. Hug them afterward and tell them that you are a sinner too who understands the need for forgiveness. That is why you are thankful for Jesus because you have done  similar  things  to  what  they  just  did,  and  you  are  glad  Jesus  has  forgiven you.  Spanking  should  wait  until  the  child  is  old  enough  to  understand expectations and can start responding to directions. "}

Some even try to disguise their gossip and slander as a prayer request: \"He's really gone off the deep end. We need to pray for him.\" Why do we gossip and slander? We do it for revenge, out of jealousy, or out of the pride of wanting to be in the know. "}
{"Question": "What motivates people to engage in gossip and slander, based on the information provided?", "Answer": "Gossip and Slander (11:13) Proverbs  condemns  gossip  and  slander.  Gossip  is  revealing  a  secret,  while slander  is  defaming  people's  reputation  or  mocking  them.  When  it  comes  to gossip,  some  folks  just  love  to  be  in  the  know.  Some  just  cannot  keep  secrets.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs view the act of self-praise and what advice does it offer instead?", "Answer": "Bragging (27:2) Proverbs condemns bragging. It says, \"Let another praise you, and not your own mouth-a  stranger,  and  not  your  own  lips\"  (27:2).  Do  not  praise  yourself  or embellish  your  accomplishments.  A  modern  paraphrase  of  this  might  be something  like,  \"Let  another  tweet  about  you  and  not  your  own  tweet-a stranger and not your own account!\" So often self-exaltation is seen as good and necessary to get ahead in our culture. Or you know people who always turn the conversation back to themselves no matter what you say. Toby Keith sings about this  when  he  wants  to  \"talk  about  me.\"  Why  do  we  do  this?  We  do  it  because either we are insecure or we want to exalt ourselves. The gospel can cure both of those  things  because  God's  approval  in  Christ  is  incompatible  with  insecurity, and the humility of Christ in laying down his life for others is antithetical to self- exaltation.

{"Question": "How does harmful speech impact relationships beyond immediate conflicts and divisions?", "Answer": "But it's more than that. It's not just that being a contentious person will cause conflict  and  divide  groups,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  flattery  ruins marriages  and  families,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  deception  ruins friendships  or  careers,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  gossip  divides  friends and  hurts  people's  feelings,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  bragging  makes people nauseated to be around you, although it does. The biggest problem is that harmful  speech  separates  you  from  a  relationship  with  God  and  invites judgment.  All  of  the  temporal  consequences  of  broken  relationships  are  just  a foretaste of hell. Jesus says we will be held accountable for every careless word we utter (Matt 12:36). Verses like Proverbs 10:31 teach us, \"The mouth of the righteous  produces  wisdom,  but  a  perverse  tongue  will  be  cut  out.\"  And  19:9 adds, \"A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies perishes.\" "}
{"Question": "How do the cited Bible verses offer a solution or remedy to the challenge of taming the tongue?", "Answer": "Conclusion Words are powerful indeed. The tongue is difficult to tame. But there are words that  overcome  our  sinful  and  uncontrolled  tongues.  They  are  words  like, \"Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those in Christ Jesus\" (Rom 8:1), and words like \"The fruit of the Spirit is . . . self-control\" (Gal 5:22-23). Praise God for those words! "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs advise regarding listening to others and reliance on self-judgment?", "Answer": "I. Don't Listen to Anyone but Yourself (12:15; 15:5,22,31,33). II. Speak Before You Listen and Speak More Than You Listen (10:19; 17:27-28). III. Listen to Unwise Counsel (12:5). "}

{"Question": "How does self-deception impact individuals beyond their own perceptions of themselves?", "Answer": "People are self-deceived. The man on this video is convinced that he is a good singer, but any objective evaluation clearly reveals that he is not. That's not just a problem for him or for singers trying to make it on American Idol. It's a problem for  all  of  us.  We  all  can  convince  ourselves  that  we  are  good  parents,  great spouses,  or  wonderful  employees  without  actually  putting  in  the  work  to  be skilled  at  any  of  these  (Ten  Elshof,  I  Told  Me  So,  1-5).  This  self-deception  will catch  up  to  us  eventually  and  can  cause  more  than  embarrassment.  We  know folks  who  have  lost  their  teaching  positions  because  they  were  convinced  that they  were  great  teachers  and  did  not  need  to  heed  their  evaluations  that  they were  too  abrasive  in  their  interactions  with  students.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 15:31 frame the concept of wisdom in relation to receiving wise rebuke?", "Answer": "Proverbs  15:31  indicates  that  wisdom  is  listening  to  wise  rebuke,  and  thus foolishness  is  the  opposite:  not  listening  to  a  wise  rebuke!  Wisdom  will  not come unless we listen to wise counsel from outside of us because it is not in us. As  Longman  points  out,  \"Only  the  wise  are  willing  to  admit  mistakes,  change behavior and improve their lives,\" which requires listening to correction (Proverbs, 323). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 12:15 emphasize the necessity of seeking counsel for wisdom?", "Answer": "Proverbs  12:15  adds,  \"A  fool's  way  is  right  in  his  own  eyes,  but  whoever listens to counsel is wise.\"  The way that seems right leads to death, but if you listen to outside counsel you will be wise. Left to ourselves we do not choose the right path. We see this with our children. They do not naturally share; they have to be made to share. They do not naturally pick up their rooms; they have to be instructed to clean their rooms. "}

{"Question": "How does Proverbs emphasize the importance of children listening to and obeying their parents?", "Answer": "This  is  true  in  so  many  areas  of  our  lives.  The  need  for  children  to  listen  to parents  is  repeated  over  and  over  in  Proverbs.  Proverbs  15:5  states,  \"A  fool despises his father's discipline, but a person who accepts correction is sensible.\" This verse means that children should listen to what their parents say and obey them while they live under their roof. It also means that they should seek counsel from  their  parents  when  they  no  longer  live  in  the  same  house!  The  Bible indicates  that  church  members  should  hear  and  obey  their  leaders  who  speak God's word to them (Heb 13:7,17). The Bible exhorts younger people to listen to the counsel of the elderly (Titus 2:4). Consequently, younger parents should seek counsel from older parents who are further along in the parenting task. Younger husbands  should  seek  counsel  from  older  husbands  on  how  to  handle  money, interview for a job, or lead their families. "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of humility in listening challenge the popular notion of self-reliance?", "Answer": "Proverbs  15:33  explains  that  listening  requires  a  posture  of  humility.  Instead of  \"I  did  it  my  way,\"  recognize  that  you  do  not  have  everything  figured  out. Why  does  it  require  humility?  We  are  prideful  and  do  not  naturally  submit ourselves  to  other  people's  advice  if  it  does  not  match  up  with  what  we  think. Our  sinful  reaction  is  immediately  to  think,  \"I  know  better  than  you!\"  In  our culture people are rarely corrected, and even if we are corrected in love, our first reaction is usually not to thank people for their concern. Rather, we bristle, get mad, and think of reasons why they are not fit to talk to us about this situation. Wisdom is the humility to recognize you do not know everything and to ask for counsel. "}

{"Question": "How does Solomon link wisdom with trust and dependence on Yahweh in his teachings?", "Answer": "In  concert  with  the  humility  to  listen,  Solomon  teaches  that  wisdom  is ultimately trust and dependence on Yahweh. Whether or not you depend on the Lord  is  revealed  in  whether  or  not  you  listen  to  counsel.  Whether  or  not  you submit  to  truth  and  authority  in  all  the  areas  of  your  life  reveals  what  your relationship is like with the Lord. It is hard to humble ourselves and submit to the Lord's authority, and that is shown in the fact that it is hard for us to submit to  our  earthly  authorities  like  parents,  government  officials,  bosses,  or  even pastors. It is hard because we think that our way is right. Wisdom requires the ability to recognize that you can deceive yourself, you are not always right, and you need to submit humbly to wise instruction as you submit to the Lord! "}
{"Question": "Why is it important, based on the text, to prioritize one's own judgment over that of others?", "Answer": "So do you want to be a fool? Then do not listen to anyone but yourself. Only take  your  own  ideas.  Be  convinced  that  you  are  the  only  one  who  is  right  and that you are smarter than everyone else. No one else is looking out for you and wants your best interest like you do. So listen to yourself, not others! "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of talking excessively relate to wisdom according to the book of Proverbs?", "Answer": "Proverbs  talks  a  lot  about  the  use  of  our  tongues,  and  one  key  exhortation  is, \"Don't  talk  so  much!\"  Some  people  really  struggle  with  talking  too  much.  I  ( Jon)  confess that I  am one of them. I often try to finish my wife's  thoughts or jump into the conversation in the middle of her sentence. If you are the kind of person  who  always  wants  to  give  your  opinion  first,  or  if  you  are  not  really listening to the other person in conversation, or when you are in a conversation you  just  wait  for  your  turn  to  talk,  then  that  is  a  sign  of  foolishness.  Proverbs teaches  that  we  need  to  learn  to  restrain  our  mouths.  Proverbs  10:19  states, \"When there are many words, sin is unavoidable, but the one who controls his lips is prudent.\" Proverbs 17:27-28 adds, "}
{"Question": "How is the concept of wisdom tied to the restraint of speech in the excerpt?", "Answer": "The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding. Even a fool is considered wise when he keeps silent-discerning, when he seals his lips. These verses sound similar to the more modern proverb attributed to Abraham Lincoln:  \"Better  to  remain  silent  and  be  thought  a  fool  than  to  speak  out  and remove all doubt.\" Proverbs is clear that speaking a lot leads to sin, whereas a restrained mouth is a sign of wisdom. At the very least, one might be considered wise-even  if  he  is  not-with  a  little  less  talking.  As  Goldsworthy  points  out, \"Ironically, the fool who has the wit to keep silent shows at least some potential for wisdom\" (Tree of Life, 131). "}

{"Question": "What is the consequence of unrestrained speech according to the evaluation in Proverbs?", "Answer": "The second reason to restrain your tongue is because it will prevent you from self-confident  speech.  Proverbs  evaluates  self-confident  speech  as  foolishness. Self-confident speech is defined as loving to hear yourself talk or always having to  give  your  own  opinion  on  a  matter.  Proverbs  18:2  says,  \"A  fool  does  not delight  in  understanding,  but  only  wants  to  show  off  his  opinions.\"  Longman explains, "}
{"Question": "In what way do fools in Proverbs prioritize their own desires and opinions over others' competence?", "Answer": "The verse suggests that fools are again only interested in their own desires and ideas . . . [they do not] want to listen to people with competence. They only want to blurt out what is on their minds. (Proverbs, 354) "}
{"Question": "What are some behavioral patterns exhibited by the fool as described in the text?", "Answer": "Not only does the fool usually listen only to himself, and not only does the fool speak more than he listens; but when the fool finally decides to listen to someone else,  he  listens  to  another  fool!  When  you  finally  listen  to  someone  else,  it  is only  to  unwise,  ungodly  counsel.  For  many  people  this  means  surrounding themselves with \"yes men\" who will simply tell them what they want to hear. So ask yourself these questions: Do you surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear, but not what you need to hear? Is there anyone in your life who has the freedom to lovingly criticize you or tell you no? "}
{"Question": "What potential issue arises when discernment is emphasized in discussions or disagreements?", "Answer": "Let's  make  a  disclaimer  at  this  point.  There  is  a  potential  problem  in  even bringing this discernment up because when we say discernment is required, all of  a  sudden  we  \"discern\"  that  anyone  who  disagrees  with  our  opinion  on  the matter  is  unwise  and  should  not  be  heeded.  Again,  that  is  because  we  deceive ourselves and close our minds to counsel. If the person is willing to tell us what we need to hear, even if it is uncomfortable, and if their counsel runs consistent with the Bible, then you can be fairly confident that you need to listen to it. And even if you are not sure, you can always ask the question and ponder, \"Is there something I need to hear here?\" "}

{"Question": "How does the elderly lady's situation exemplify the prevalence of ungodly counsel among Christians?", "Answer": "Unfortunately,  we  are  amazed  by  how  often  ungodly,  unbiblical  counsel  can come  from  other  Christians.  I  (  Jon)  once  knew  an  elderly  lady  who  began  a relationship with an unbeliever who had multiple failed marriages. They wanted to  get  married,  but  their  pastor  was  reluctant  because  the  groom  was  not  a Christian and because of his past failures. They liked each other and were lonely living by themselves, so they wanted to move in together while they waited for a pastor who would marry them. All of her Christian friends told her to go ahead and move in with the guy. They said at her age it was not that big a deal. That is an obvious example of unbiblical counsel, but we all can be guilty of the same thing.  Whenever  you  are  listening  to  counsel,  if  your  situation  is  seen  as  an exception clause to the biblical testimony, then you can bet that it is not godly advice.  People  love  to  follow  God's  Word  when  it  suits  them,  but  we  always think  our  situation  is  the  exception.  It's  not!  Do  not  let  anyone  tell  you otherwise! "}
{"Question": "What transformation occurs when individuals embrace Jesus as the embodiment of God's wisdom?", "Answer": "The antidote is Jesus. Recognize your foolishness here, confess it to the Lord, and ask him for the wisdom that he gives generously. Ask Jesus to enable you to listen and measure words in the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Wisdom of God who has become wisdom for you and can make you wise. Read and listen to God's Word to gain wisdom. You will recognize that you are not always right and you need to submit to God's truth. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs suggest that our associations influence our own wisdom or foolishness?", "Answer": "You  also  need  Christ's  body;  you  need  a  community  of  faith.  In  the  church, you live life together and depend on each other. Proverbs is clear that associating with fools will make you foolish, but uniting with the wise will make you wise. Therefore, you need to be in relationships with other Christians who are seeking to walk with Jesus. You need to give these brothers and sisters freedom to speak into your life, just as you have freedom to speak into theirs. "}
{"Question": "How does seeking counsel from the godliest individuals align with making tough decisions?", "Answer": "When  you  are  faced  with  a  tough  decision,  you  do  not  want  to  seek  counsel from those who will simply tell you what you want to hear. You need to be able to ask, \"Who are the godliest people I know, and what do they think about this?\" Do  not  adopt  a  \"me  and  Jesus\"  approach  to  decision  making.  That  is  foolish because it's usually more \"me\" than Jesus. "}
{"Question": "How does the passage challenge societal norms regarding confrontation and honesty in relationships?", "Answer": "We must learn how to speak up because people need to hear the truth spoken in love (Eph 4:15). We need people who will lovingly tell us the truth! If your friend has something stuck in her teeth or tissue paper on her shoe or his fly is open,  it  is  not  loving  to  simply  stay  quiet  out  of  fear  that  he  or  she  might  be embarrassed.  And  if  someone  is  on  a  fool's  path,  it  is  not  loving  to  refuse  to confront him simply because the world might say it is harsh. The world is wrong in many cases, and this is one of them! "}
{"Question": "In what scenarios does the text suggest it is imperative to voice concerns or advice to others?", "Answer": "We  all  intuitively  know  there  are  times  we  need  to  speak  up.  For  example, when our friend is in a foolish relationship that is no good for him, we have to say something. When our friend is making dumb decisions with her money that constantly put her in bad situations, we need to speak up. When our brother in Christ  is  involved  in  something  that  jeopardizes  his  marriage,  we  have  to lovingly confront. Unfortunately, we often bite our tongues and say to ourselves things like, \"Oh, I could not possibly say anything.\" \"Oh, they won't listen to me anyway.\"  People  make  foolish  decisions  that  destroy  their  reputations, marriages,  families,  and  their  eternities.  So  while  it  is  tough  and  awkward  to speak up, we must do it! "}
{"Question": "What key question does the text propose in relation to confronting someone you care about?", "Answer": "The question we want to examine from Proverbs is, How do I do it?

{"Question": "How does Proverbs emphasize the significance of aligning one's speech with biblical wisdom?", "Answer": "The Right Word The first criterion for speaking up is the right word. Is what you are about to say true?  Or  better  stated,  is  what  you  are  about  to  say  consistent  with  the  Bible? Proverbs has clearly stated that true wisdom comes from the mouth of God (2:6). Therefore, we do not need to advise people with our opinions; we need to advise them from the Bible. Too many people-when they actually do speak up-speak out of what they think rather than from what God has said. On social media you can  see  all  kinds  of  confrontation  about  how  to  give  birth  to  a  child,  how  to discipline a child, or how to date your wife, and much of it seems very dogmatic -even the advice that is blatantly wrong. If you are going to speak up, you need to be sure that what you are saying is consistent with the Bible, so take the time and do the work to make sure! "}
{"Question": "What questions are suggested to clarify if a conflict is one's own battle to fight?", "Answer": "From the Right Person To figure out if you are the right person, you need to be able to positively answer the question, Is this my fight? To figure out if that is the case, ask questions like, Am  I  the  offended  party?  Am  I  accountable  for  the  offended  party?  Am  I accountable  for  the  offender?  Proverbs  puts  it  this  way:  \"A  person  who  is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that's not his is like one who grabs a dog by the ears\" (26:17). As Longman points out, \"It is obviously stupid to pull the ears of  a  dog.\"  Therefore,  the  verse  \"ridicules  those  who  would  get  involved  in  a fight in which they have no part\" (Proverbs, 469).

{"Question": "How would you describe individuals who constantly engage in confrontation and calling people out?", "Answer": "Do  not  be  the  \"confrontation  police.\"  Some  people  love  to  do  this  kind  of thing.  They  love  calling  people  out,  putting  them  in  their  place,  or  getting  in their business. Some people think their calling in life is to be an Old Testament prophet.  They  love  telling  their  friends  how  they  told  someone  off.  They  love jumping in and trolling on Facebook or Twitter. "}
{"Question": "What analogy does Proverbs use to caution against interfering in someone else's argument?", "Answer": "Proverbs says that jumping into someone else's argument is like slapping a pit bull  in  the  face.  It's  not  going  to  go  well  for  you!  Do  not  jump  into  someone else's fight. Do not speak up if it is not your place. Some fights need to be had, but they need to be by the right person.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs advise on determining whether it is appropriate to intervene in a dispute?", "Answer": "Proverbs says that jumping into someone else's argument is like slapping a pit bull  in  the  face.  It's  not  going  to  go  well  for  you!  Do  not  jump  into  someone else's fight. Do not speak up if it is not your place. Some fights need to be had, but they need to be by the right person.

{"Question": "How does the absence of forgiveness impact the potential outcome of a conflict resolution process?", "Answer": "In the Right Way True  forgiveness  and  kindness  must  be  present  before  any  confrontation.  It  is easy  to  confront  a  wrong  done  you  if  you  are  hurt,  but  you  usually  do  not  go about  it  in  the  right  way  unless  you  have  moved  toward  forgiveness.  Without forgiveness, there will not be conflict resolution-only revenge. "}
{"Question": "In what way does Proverbs 24:29 caution against seeking retribution for wrongdoings?", "Answer": "There cannot be the slightest bit of bitterness or a desire to get someone back, or it will blow up in your face. Proverbs 24:29 says, \"Don't say, â€˜I'll do to him what  he  did  to  me;  I'll  repay  the  man  for  what  he  has  done.'\"  I  have  seen families  in  a  church  meet  for  conflict  resolution,  but  each  party  merely  wants their case to be heard and to win the day. It has driven families apart and out of the church. Resist a superiority complex where you look down on the person you confront as if you are not a sinner or could never have done what they did. Let go of your grudge before you talk. "}

{"Question": "How does dwelling on past offenses affect relationships, according to Proverbs 17:9?", "Answer": "If you dwell on what was done, turn it over in your mind often, and talk about it a lot with other people, then you are not going about it in the right way. Stop bringing  it  up!  Proverbs  17:9  warns,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense  promotes love,  but  whoever  gossips  about  it  separates  friends.\"  Be  willing  to  let  it  go. Overcome  evil  with  good,  since  judgment  ultimately  belongs  to  God,  not  you. Forgive as God in Christ has forgiven you (Eph 4:32)! Longman reminds us that \"a person who harps on problems will drive another away, robbing people of the opportunity  to  develop  a  relationship,\"  but  love  \"keeps  no  record  of  wrongs\" (1 Cor 13:5) (Proverbs, 345).

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 10:12 emphasize the importance of love and forgiveness in managing conflicts?", "Answer": "Only  after  you  have  worked  through  forgiveness  can  you  then  confront. Proverbs 10:12 states, \"Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers all offenses.\" If your  confrontation  is  motivated  by  a  desire  to  get  someone  back,  it  will  not work.  In  fact,  it  will  only  make  it  worse.  There  are  some  things  that  you  just need to let go. But if your desire is forgiveness and reconciliation, there is hope! Also, the right way to confront someone is to do it with gentleness and love, or what Paul calls, \"speaking the truth in love\" (Eph 4:15). Proverbs 15:1 says, \"A gentle  answer  turns  away  anger,  but  a  harsh  word  stirs  up  wrath.\"  The temperaments we bring to the confrontation will make all the difference (Garrett, Proverbs, 150). Do you have the self-control to give a reasoned response? (Waltke, Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  612-13).  Gentleness  does  not  imply  mealy  mouthed  or indirect-it  can  be  a  tough  gentleness!  The  question  is,  Are  your  words motivated  by  love  for  her  or  by  a  desire  to  put  her  in  her  place?  Are  you genuinely concerned for the person, and therefore you will confront her kindly? "}
{"Question": "In what way do Proverbs 25:11-12 emphasize the significance of timing in communication?", "Answer": "At the Right Time It  is  crucial  that  you  speak  up  at  the  right  time.  Proverbs  25:11-12  states,  \"A word  spoken  at  the  right  time  is  like  gold  apples  in  silver  settings.  A  wise correction  to  a  receptive  ear  is  like  a  gold  ring  or  an  ornament  of  gold.\"  You have to speak at the right moment (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 126). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs address the need for wisdom in knowing when to communicate the truth effectively?", "Answer": "You  may  have  the  truth  and  say  it  in  a  gentle  way,  but  it  will  not  be  well received because you do not speak up at the right time. Proverbs does not give us a  \"how-to\"  manual  to  know  when  is  the  right  time.  Knowing  the  right  time requires discernment. Thankfully, God promises that if we lack wisdom, we can ask him and he will give it to us ( Jas 1). "}
{"Question": "What potential consequences can arise from the fool's actions in the scenarios described?", "Answer": "A  fool,  on  the  other  hand,  speaks  with  no  regard  to  the  circumstances.  He comes  in  when  his  wife  looks  frazzled  and  is  complaining  about  how  the  kids have been a handful all day, and he says, \"Honey, we need to have a talk.\" Or the fool wants to criticize the church to the pastor right after the pastor gets done preaching his heart out to his people. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 15:23 emphasize the importance of timing in delivering a wise word?", "Answer": "Proverbs  15:23  says,  \"A  person  takes  joy  in  giving  an  answer;  and  a  timely word-how  good  that  is!\"  Goldsworthy  notes,  \"There  is  great  satisfaction  in being  able  to  give  a  wise  word  at  the  right  time\"  (Tree  of  Life,  116).  Too  many people  who  actually  do  speak  up  have  the  mentality,  \"I  told  them  the  truth.  If they  do  not  receive  it,  that's  their  problem.\"  No!  Proverbs  says  that  it  is  your problem.  Truth  that  is  not  delivered  at  the  right  time  will  not  be  received. Sometimes  you  need  to  wait.  At  other  times  you  need  take  courage  and  speak immediately. Ask the Lord to help you with discernment. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs categorize individuals who are unreceptive to well-intentioned communication?", "Answer": "To the Right Person Some people will never respond rightly, nor will they receive what you say no matter how gentle you are or how timely you are.

{"Question": "What potential consequences are outlined for rebuking a mocker or the wicked?", "Answer": "The one who corrects a mocker will bring abuse on himself; the one who rebukes the wicked will get hurt. Don't rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke the wise, and he will love you. (9:7-8) "}
{"Question": "Can we infer a recommendation regarding when to offer rebuke based on the given verses?", "Answer": "The one who corrects a mocker will bring abuse on himself; the one who rebukes the wicked will get hurt.

{"Question": "How does the response to correction vary between a mocker and a wise person?", "Answer": "The mocker will not listen to your correction no matter how you go about it. On the other hand, the wise person will receive correction and will want to grow and change. "}
{"Question": "In contrast to the mocker, how does the wise person approach receiving correction?", "Answer": "The mocker will not listen to your correction no matter how you go about it. On the other hand, the wise person will receive correction and will want to grow and change. "}

{"Question": "How did the individual's reaction to Jon's confrontation evolve over time?", "Answer": "Early in ministry I ( Jon) was discipling a guy who had a particular struggle with pornography. One time when we were hanging out, I confronted him very directly about his struggles and his excuses for them. He got up and walked out on me.

I am involved in conversations with a person who used to attend our church that involved in conversations with a person who used to attend our church that has done some pretty bad things and I've been able to repeatedly share God's love with him as well as his imminent danger should he not repent.

{"Question": "How does one's ability to handle confrontation impact their capacity to confront others with grace?", "Answer": "If  you  can  take  confrontation  well,  then  you  can  learn  to  confront  with gracious intent. You do it for the right reason, not to be seen as right or to get others'  approval  but  because  you  have  God's  approval  in  Christ.

{"Question": "What was the primary reason for the public uproar over the statement, as indicated in the text?", "Answer": "That  is  why  people  got  so  enraged  when  a  Southern  Baptist  Convention president had the audacity to say, \"God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew\"  (\"Baptist  Leader\").  There  were  all  kinds  of  reasons  that  the  comment sparked  controversy  and  outrage  in  a  world  with  multiple  religions  and  a fondness for cultural pluralism. But one of the biggest reasons people were upset was  not  because  of  the  perceived  offense  to  the  Jewish  faith  specifically  but rather because anyone, especially a pastor, would dare suggest that God does not hear  someone's  prayer.  Everyone  believes  that  God  hears  and  responds  to  our prayers. "}
{"Question": "Can we discern from the Bible instances where God chooses not to respond to individuals' prayers?", "Answer": "Is it possible that God would give someone \"the silent treatment\"? Honestly, the Bible says yes to this question. God does give the silent treatment to some people. That might be alarming for many people. If that is true, some important questions need to be asked like, Whose prayer does God hear? Why might he not listen to mine? How can I pray in such a way that God will answer me? "}
{"Question": "How does the message in Proverbs 15:29 impact the manner in which one approaches prayer?", "Answer": "Let's look to the Proverbs and see the answers to these questions, so that our prayer  lives  can  be  radically  changed.  Proverbs  15:29  says,  \"The  LORD  is  far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.\" What does this mean? "}
{"Question": "In what ways can an understanding of Proverbs influence the transformation of one's prayer life?", "Answer": "Let's look to the Proverbs and see the answers to these questions, so that our prayer  lives  can  be  radically  changed.  Proverbs  15:29  says,  \"The  LORD  is  far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.\" What does this mean? "}
{"Question": "How does Hebrew poetic parallelism enhance the depth and understanding of the verse's message?", "Answer": "This  verse  uses  Hebrew  poetic  parallelism.  There  are  several  kinds  of parallelism:  sometimes  the  second  line  says  something  similar  to  the  first; sometimes it says the opposite. In this case, one line can be looked at to fill out the other. So when the first line says that the Lord is far from wicked people, we can  conclude  that  he  is  near  righteous  people;  and  when  it  says  he  hears  the prayer  of  the  righteous,  we  can  surmise  that  he  does  not  hear  the  prayer  of wicked people. "}
{"Question": "In what way does rejection of God's law and instruction categorize individuals as \"wicked\"?", "Answer": "The problem for many of us is that we assume we are righteous. We think to ourselves, \"I am basically a good person,\" and we assume that God hears us. But the question must be asked, Who are \"the wicked\"? The Bible indicates that  we are!  The  wicked  are  those  who  reject  God's  law  and  instruction-those  who disobey  his  word.  We  have  all  sinned  and  fallen  short  of  God's  glory  (Rom 3:23).  We  are  all  wicked,  and  that  is  why  Proverbs  28:9  says,  \"Anyone  who turns his ear away from hearing the law-even his prayer is detestable.\" If you do not listen to Yahweh's word to you, he will not listen to your words to him! Murphy  and  Huwiler  refer  to  the  \"deafness  of  a  person\"  and  the  \"deafness  of God\" to their prayer (Proverbs, 138). Yahweh finds the prayers of sinners-all of us-detestable. He finds them repugnant (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 413). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs characterize the wicked behavior that leads to God not hearing their prayers?", "Answer": "Therefore, if you do not listen to God's word (i.e., obey it), God will not listen to you. This includes sins of commission and omission-doing what you are not supposed to do and not doing what you are supposed to do. So if you lie, take God's  name  in  vain,  or  take  something  that  does  not  belong  to  you  (sins  of commission),  then  God  will  not  hear  your  prayer.  And  if  you  can't  let  go  of  a grudge,  you  are  selfish,  or  you  do  not  serve  your  wife  (sins  of  omission),  then God will not hear your prayer. For example, Proverbs says that the wicked are those  who  refuse  to  be  generous  to  the  poor,  and  thus  God  does  not  hear  their prayer: \"The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will himself also call out and not be answered\" (21:13). If you are not generous to your neighbor, God will not hear your prayers. Murphy and Huwiler argue that it could be either man or God here in this verse (Proverbs, 105). "}
{"Question": "What common assumption regarding goodness and divine favor does the text challenge?", "Answer": "In some ways, this truth may not seem all that shocking. Many people think, \"If you are a good person, God will listen to you; and if you are a bad person, God will not listen to you.\" We tend toward a works-righteousness approach that believes God is always more favorable to good people. "}
{"Question": "What misconception about God's acceptance and listening is addressed in the text?", "Answer": "So at this point you may be thinking, \"God will never accept me or listen to me because of all the sinful things I have done . . . he only hears good, church- going people.\" We think he only listens to pious people who pray in King James English using \"thee and thou.\" So you might be thinking you are going to have to  clean  up  your  act  and  start  doing  what  God  wants  you  to  do  so  that  he  will listen to you; and by that you mean things like get back in church, start giving, and  be  part  of  Bible  studies.  Wrong!  Proverbs  15:8  says,  \"The  sacrifice  of  the wicked  is  detestable  to  the  LORD,  but  the  prayer  of  the  upright  is  his  delight.\" Goldsworthy writes, \"The folly of the wicked is to think that formal and outward adherence to the law can benefit them in any way at all\" (Tree  of  Life, 115). The issue  is  the  \"sacrificer,\"  not  the  sacrifice;  it's  the  one  doing  the  ritual,  not  the ritual  itself.  God  cannot  stand  mere  religious  ritual  because  it  is  an  attempt  to manipulate  God.  Religious  ritual  that  is  not  accompanied  by  heart  change  is worthless.

{"Question": "How does the psalmist in Psalm 24 define the kind of individual who can approach God?", "Answer": "We have a big problem: God does not respond to the prayers of the wicked, and  that  is  us.  And  if  religion  is  not  the  answer,  how  can  we  pray  at  all? Humanity  has  had  this  problem  since  the  garden  of  Eden-we  have  been separated from God. In Psalm 24 the psalmist asks a key question about who can approach  God.  The  answer:  \"The  one  who  has  clean  hands  and  a  pure  heart\" (24:4). Clearly that is not us; only one man in history fits that description-Jesus of Nazareth, the King of glory (Ps 24:7). "}

{"Question": "How is the concept of humble dependence central to the idea of praying in Jesus's name?", "Answer": "Since we are wicked and do not deserve for God to hear us, and since the only way we have access is through Jesus, then the only manner in which we should come  before  God  is  humble  dependence.  We  recognize  that  it  is  only  through Jesus that we have access. That is what it means to pray in Jesus's name.

{"Question": "What role do rituals accompanied by penitent piety play in honoring God, as suggested in the text?", "Answer": "If you think you are good enough, you are dead wrong. The only way to come into God's presence is to admit that you do not belong. Righteousness is found in repentance. As Proverbs has indicated, rituals that are not accompanied with penitent  piety  are  detestable.  We  do  not  try  to  manipulate  God;  we  humbly depend on his mercy through Christ. "}
{"Question": "How does this parable challenge traditional notions of religious observance and righteousness?", "Answer": "Conclusion Jesus  told  the  story  of  two  men  praying-a  Pharisee  and  a  tax  collector.  God accepted  one  man's  prayer  and  rejected  the  other  man's  prayer.  The  shocking turn  of  events  was  that  the  story  did  not  follow  expected  patterns.  Everyone listening to Jesus expected the righteous-looking, religious Pharisee to be heard; and  they  expected  the  sinful  tax  collector  to  be  given  the  silent  treatment.  But Jesus said the tax collector was heard because he was too ashamed to even lift his eyes to heaven as he said, \"God, have mercy on me, a sinner!\" (Luke 18:13). God  did  not  only  hear  that  man,  but  God  also  justified  him.  If  you  want  to  be heard by the King of the universe, then come humbly as a sinner and plead the mercy of Christ. "}

{"Question": "What does Proverbs 14:30 suggest about the impact of jealousy on an individual's well-being?", "Answer": "The  Bible  seems  to  say  the  same  thing  about  envy.  Envy  never  helps  the situation,  and  it  ends  up  hurting  you.  We  see  examples  of  this  throughout  pop culture. In the movie Gladiator, the jealousy of the emperor toward Maximus was the  emperor's  undoing.  In  the  movie  Toy  Story,  Woody's  jealousy  toward  Buzz ended  up  hurting  Woody.  In  our  own  lives,  our  jealousy  of  others  can  lead  to depression,  low  self-esteem,  anger,  bitterness,  and  other  issues.  That  is  exactly what Solomon tells us through the Holy Spirit about jealousy and envy. Jealousy does not help; it only hurts. Proverbs 14:30 says, \"A tranquil heart is life to the body,  but  jealousy  is  rottenness  to  the  bones.\"  Jealousy  has  psychosomatic effects on you (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 71). It is like a cancer in your soul. "}

{"Question": "How does Longman distinguish between jealousy and envy in his explanation based on \"Proverbs\"?", "Answer": "Envy-wanting  something  someone  else  has-is  destructive.  So  many  of  us want things that other people have. We envy their clothes, their car, their house, their  bank  account,  and  their  popularity.  That  attitude  is  destructive,  but  the reverse  attitude  can  be  as  well.  Jealousy  sometimes  looks  like  the  craving  to keep what is ours and not let it become someone else's. Longman explains both of  these  and  makes  his  own  distinction  between  jealousy  and  envy  when  he writes,  \"Jealousy  is  the  angry  desire  to  keep  what  we  possess  and  are  afraid someone else wants,\" whereas envy \"is the angry desire for what someone else possesses\" (Proverbs, 476).

Or you compete for his affection because you want it all for yourself. This kind of jealousy also can happen in corporate life.

{"Question": "In what instances does the Bible consider jealousy to be a justifiable and even righteous emotion?", "Answer": "The Bible condemns that kind of jealousy, but it is a bit complicated because according to the Bible jealousy can also be a legitimate emotion (see discussion on this in Longman, Proverbs, 307). Like anger, jealousy is not always a bad thing. Jealousy  is  not  wrong  when  it  involves  an  exclusive  relationship  being threatened.  For  example,  God  is  jealous  for  his  people  and  their  exclusive devotion  to  him  (Zech  8:2;  Jas  4:5).  God  is  also  jealous  for  his  glory  (Num 25:11). There should be a positive jealousy and passion for exclusive devotion to God. "}
{"Question": "In what way does the author view a wife's questioning as a valuable contribution to the marriage?", "Answer": "The  same  can  be  said  for  our  mate  in  marriage!  Some  guys  are  real  idiots when it comes to their wife's jealousy for their relationship. Oftentimes when a wife questions her husband about a relationship with another woman out of love for  her  husband  and  concern  for  her  marriage,  the  husband  will  get  angry  and defensive  and  try  to  make  his  wife  feel  like  a  moron-like  she  does  not  know what she's talking about. That is ridiculous and foolish. Your wife's concern for your marriage and her willingness to ask you about it is a gift from God. "}
{"Question": "In what specific contexts does the text suggest that jealousy is considered morally incorrect?", "Answer": "However,  when  it  comes  to  non-exclusive  relationships  or  anger  over  what belongs  to  someone  else,  jealousy  is  wrong.

{"Question": "How does envy impact a person's well-being according to Proverbs 14:30?", "Answer": "Envy Is Deadly Because It Hurts You Envy  damages  you  emotionally,  mentally,  and  physically.

{"Question": "How does Saul's envy of David manifest into other sins according to the Bible passage mentioned?", "Answer": "Envy Is Deadly Because It Leads to Other Sins We see an example of this in the Bible in the way Saul feels about David. His jealousy of David causes him several times to try to kill David (1 Sam 18:9-11; 19:9-11) (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 375). Jealousy leads to other sins because at its root it is a belief of the heart that what God has given you is not enough. God  is  withholding  his  best  from  you.

{"Question": "What warning does Proverbs 3:31-32 offer to those tempted by envy towards sinners who prosper?", "Answer": "Envy Is Deadly Because It Will Be Judged by God Several  passages  of  Scripture  warn  us  not  to  envy  sinners  who  prosper,  since God  will  judge  them.  Wisdom  says  not  to  join  them.  Proverbs  3:31-32  states, \"Don't  envy  a  violent  man  or  choose  any  of  his  ways;  for  the  devious  are detestable to the LORD, but he is a friend to the upright.\" The application of the verse is clear: do not be envious of and thus copy the practices of a sinner. It is tempting  to  be  jealous  of  those  who  succeed  despite  their  sinful  behavior.  If  it was  not  tempting,  then  so  many  people  would  not  find  it  appealing.  When ungodly  people  find  themselves  having  all  that  they  want  while  godly  persons have very little, then godliness can seem like it does not benefit much. But we are told to avoid this, and one of the big reasons is that the Lord will condemn the  wicked.  The  tables  will  turn.  The  \"prospering  sinner\"  will  lose  all  that  he has, and the righteous will be rewarded in the end. God's approval abides on the content  person,  and  that  approval  is  worth  so  much  more  than  those  good- looking  things  the  sinner  has.  God  tells  you  to  trust  his  Word  rather  than  your experience  because  the  prosperity  of  the  ungodly  is  only  apparent;  it  will  be short lived. "}
{"Question": "How does fear of the Lord serve as a positive strategy for overcoming jealousy and envy?", "Answer": "Faith in Jesus Will Save You from Envy Proverbs  24:19-20  gave  the  negative  warning,  but  Proverbs  23:17-18  gives  the positive  promise,  \"Don't  let  your  heart  envy  sinners;  instead,  always  fear  the LORD. For then you will have a future, and your hope will not be dashed.\" We see in these verses a positive strategy for dealing with our jealousy, and it just happens to be the theme of Proverbs: fear the Lord. That means to fight off envy and  jealousy  in  your  life  is  to  trust  in  the  Lord-to  have  whole-hearted confidence  in  him!  Again,  there  is  a  temptation  to  be  jealous  of  prosperous wicked people in such a way that you copy their actions. What is the antidote? The antidote to jealousy is contentment in the Lord. What is the motivation for this  contentment?  The  future  reward  of  eternal  life  is  the  motivation  to  be content in the Lord. Again, you must have an eternal perspective (Col 3:1-2). In light  of  eternity,  if  you  fear  the  Lord,  you  will  experience  eternal  blessings.  In contrast, the wicked will lose everything that they have. "}
{"Question": "How is the notion of forgiveness interconnected with the theme of jealousy as depicted in the text?", "Answer": "Believing the gospel brings eternal and abundant life-the life that God meant for you to live. That is what the book of Proverbs is all about. The gospel story itself  is  a  story  about  jealousy.  Jealousy  killed  Jesus.  His  influence  over  the people drove the Jewish leaders to insanity. After all, the Bible says the Jewish leaders  handed  Jesus  over  to  the  Romans  \"because  of  envy\"  (Matt  27:18).  Not only was it the jealousy of the Jews that caused the death of Jesus, but our own jealousies killed him. He hung on the cross to pay the penalty for our jealousy. Every time you resented someone else's promotion, got green-eyed at someone else's popularity, or raged at another person's good looks, you added your sin in killing Jesus. "}
{"Question": "What has been the observed trend in Type 2 diabetes cases and its relationship to obesity?", "Answer": "What  is  the  result?  Women  are  at  a  double  risk  for  heart  failure.  There  has been a 50-percent rise in Type 2 diabetes that is primarily caused by obesity. A survey  done  of  813  overweight  Louisiana  school  children  showed  that  58 percent  had  at  least  one  heart  disease  risk  factor  such  as  high  blood  pressure, cholesterol, or insulin levels (D. Akin, \"Vanity of Happy Meal Christianity\"). In the  1950s,  9.7  percent  of  American  adults  were  considered  clinically  obese; today  the  United  States  leads  the  world  with  an  obesity  rate  of  more  than  30 percent-yes,  we  are  number  one!  We  have  the  highest  rate  of  calorie consumption per capita in the world. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past thirty years.

The  CDC  says  it  is  a  result  of  \"caloric  imbalance.\" Translation: we eat too much and are not active enough! Obese youth are more likely  to  have  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular  disease,  high  cholesterol,  high blood  pressure,  prediabetes,  bone  and  joint  problems,  and  sleep  apnea,  and  as adults increased risks for types of cancer (\"Childhood Obesity Facts\").

{"Question": "In what ways does the biblical text caution against the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption?", "Answer": "Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has conflicts? Who has complaints? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has red eyes? Those who linger over wine; those who go looking for mixed wine. Don't gaze at wine because it is red, because it gleams in the cup and goes down smoothly. In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper. Your eyes will see strange things, and you will say absurd things. You'll be like someone sleeping out at sea or lying down on the top of a ship's mast. \"They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I didn't know it! When will I wake up? I'll look for another drink.\" The Bible warns that alcohol will destroy you, and it is right. Sadly, there are too many instances of this reality to count. My ( Jon's) mother, Charlotte, grew up in a Baptist children's home because of an alcoholic dad and mom who could not  care  for  her.  My  adopted  cousin  was  born  with  fetal  alcohol  syndrome because of a biological mother who drank throughout her pregnancy. When she was little, my cousin would sit and bang her head against a wall for an hour as a result of the disease. These biblical warnings and sober tales need to be told in the midst of a culture that celebrates and laughs at drunkenness. Brad Paisley's song \"Alcohol\" giggles at how with alcohol you have had some of the best times you  won't  remember  and  that  it  teaches  white  people  how  to  dance.  Even  in some  Christian  circles  there  is  the  expectation  that  children  will  go  wild  in college. The Bible says that what overindulging in alcohol can do is not funny, and tragically we know that all too well in our society. "}
{"Question": "How do the references to wine in the Bible challenge common perceptions about its usage?", "Answer": "And  yet,  we  must  be  honest  that  the  Bible  also  commends  wine  in  a  certain context.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs highlight the potential consequences of overindulging in food and drink?", "Answer": "Overindulging  food  (gluttony)  or  drink  (drunkenness)  is  always  unwise  and deadly. Proverbs says it leads to poverty (23:21), and we also can observe this in our culture. Gluttony leads to poverty for all kinds of reasons.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 25:16 warn against the consequences of overindulgence with a specific example?", "Answer": "Another  reason  that  gluttony  is  deadly  is  because  it  will  make  you  sick. Proverbs  25:16  says,  \"If  you  find  honey,  eat  only  what  you  need;  otherwise, you'll get sick from it and vomit.\" The principle of this verse applies to all food (Longman, Proverbs, 455). Eating in moderation is good, but if you eat more than you  need  or  too  many  sweets,  you  can  get  sick.  Contrary  to  what  the \"theologian\" Alan Jackson says, too much of a good thing is a not a good thing. If  you  eat  too  much  you  will  be  uncomfortable,  feeling  like  you  have  a cinderblock in your chest because you are so overstuffed. You might vomit. You certainly run into health risks, as seen above. The key is knowing when to stop and having the control to be able to do it. Everybody is different, so eating \"what you  need\"  is  an  important  clarification.  That  requires  discernment  because  it may be different from what someone else needs. "}
{"Question": "What warning or advice does the text offer regarding the consumption of indulgent foods?", "Answer": "The problem here is that we train ourselves to be gluttons. The first time you eat  two  Big  Macs  you  might  feel  sick.  And  you  will  probably  feel  sick  the second  and  third  times,  but  by  the  seventh  time  you  get  used  to  it.  Instead  of keeping on until you can handle the gluttony, you need to know when to stop! "}
{"Question": "How is wisdom linked to following the law, as discussed in Proverbs 28:7?", "Answer": "Proverbs  28:7  says,  \"A  discerning  son  keeps  the  law,  but  a  companion  of gluttons humiliates his father.\" Let's pick this verse apart. Keeping the Torah is equated  with  wisdom  in  the  Bible  (Deut  4:6).  God  gives  us  commands  for  a reason-he  knows  what  is  best  for  us,  so  following  them  is  wise.  The  law commands  moderation  rather  than  a  lack  of  self-control  when  it  comes  to  our diet, and it does so for our good. The lines of this verse are parallel. Therefore, a wise son keeps the law and does not associate with gluttons, whereas a foolish son  breaks  the  law  and  associates  with  gluttons,  thus  dishonoring  his  family. You disobey God's law if you are a glutton, which is implied by the fact that the foolish  son  associates  with  them.  The  wages  of  gluttony  according  the  law  is death. "}
{"Question": "What actions are prescribed in Deuteronomy 21:18-21 for dealing with a stubborn and rebellious son?", "Answer": "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father or mother and doesn't listen to them even after they discipline him, his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown. They will say to the elders of his city, \"This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn't obey us. He's a glutton and a drunkard.\" Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid. (Deut 21:18-21) "}
{"Question": "How do the parents of the disobedient son play a role in the resolution as outlined in the text?", "Answer": "If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father or mother and doesn't listen to them even after they discipline him, his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown. They will say to the elders of his city, \"This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn't obey us. He's a glutton and a drunkard.\" Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid. (Deut 21:18-21) "}
{"Question": "What insight does the text provide on the potential dangers associated with overeating?", "Answer": "God's apparent abhorrence for gluttony is bad news for us because we have all fallen  short  here.  Who  has  not  eaten  more  than  they  should?  And  it  is  deadly. Gratifying our appetites is disastrous and condemnable. "}
{"Question": "What role does worship and belief play in maintaining long-term changes in regard to gluttony?", "Answer": "Since gluttony is a worship or belief issue, it cannot be dealt with merely at the level of behavior modification. There is some value in modifying behavior. Go on a diet, start exercising, and eat smaller portions. But you have to go further than that because without right belief the change will be short lived. That is why so many make New Year's resolutions to go on a diet and start working out, but by February the treadmill is already collecting dust in the corner. "}
{"Question": "What is the significance of the metaphor involving a treadmill collecting dust by February?", "Answer": "Since gluttony is a worship or belief issue, it cannot be dealt with merely at the level of behavior modification.

{"Question": "How did Jesus demonstrate the balance between fasting and feasting in various contexts?", "Answer": "Our failure should drive us to Jesus and satisfaction in him. Jesus knew when to  fast  in  the  wilderness,  when  to  feast  at  the  wedding  in  Cana,  and  how  to balance!  Jesus  perfectly  kept  this  law  because  he  knew  man  does  not  live  by bread alone but by the Word of God. His appetites did not control him; rather, he controlled his appetites. In Matthew 4, when Satan tempted Jesus, he refused to give in to his hunger pangs. What is it like to be really starving and have bread at your fingertips and say, \"No!\"? Jesus had self-control. "}
{"Question": "How did Jesus prioritize spiritual nourishment over physical sustenance, as depicted in Matthew 4?", "Answer": "Our failure should drive us to Jesus and satisfaction in him.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs highlight the self-destructive nature of greed as depicted in 11:24-26 and 28:22?", "Answer": "A. Greed is foolish because it hurts you (11:24-26; 28:22). B. Greed is foolish because it hurts the people around you (15:7). C. Greed is foolish because money doesn't last (23:4-5). II. Greed Is Deadly Because It Is Unbelief (11:28; 28:25). III.

{"Question": "How does the Bible portray the consequences of greed in the text?", "Answer": "Greed is a temptation for all of us, and the Bible says it is deadly. Greed will destroy you. We can see this destruction all around us. The problem is that we think  we  do  not  really  struggle  with  greed  because  we  do  not  have  a  lot  of money. But the apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Timothy 6 that just to want to be rich and have stuff is deadly (v. 9). You do not have to be rich to crave riches, and a greedy heart shows a life that is walking away from satisfaction in Jesus. And what Paul tells us in the New Testament is echoed throughout the book of Proverbs-greed is deadly. We see this truth clearly in Proverbs 11:24-28. "}

{"Question": "How does Proverbs characterize the nature of greed and its consequences?", "Answer": "Proverbs  argues  that  greed  is  foolish  and  deadly,  and  you  should  be  able  to observe  that  in  everyday  life.  There  are  too  many  modern  examples  of  this  to count. Dr. Seuss's story \"The Lorax\" reveals the deadly effects of greed on the environment. The main character abuses natural resources for his own gain.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 28:22 support the notion that greed is ultimately self-destructive?", "Answer": "Greed Is Foolish Because It Hurts You (11:24-26; 28:22) Greed  hurts  us  in  all  kinds  of  ways.  Greed  might  make  you  a  workaholic  who misses out on time with family, or it might make you a miserly kind of person who refuses to be kind to others.

{"Question": "How does the act of giving align with the idea of gaining more, as mentioned in the text?", "Answer": "One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor. A generous person will be enriched, and the one who gives a drink of water will receive water. People will curse anyone who hoards grain, but a blessing will come to the one who sells it. "}
{"Question": "How are enriching and receiving water linked to the concept of generosity in the text?", "Answer": "One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor. A generous person will be enriched, and the one who gives a drink of water will receive water. People will curse anyone who hoards grain, but a blessing will come to the one who sells it. "}
{"Question": "What consequences are associated with hoarding grain versus selling it, according to the passage?", "Answer": "One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor. A generous person will be enriched, and the one who gives a drink of water will receive water. People will curse anyone who hoards grain, but a blessing will come to the one who sells it. "}
{"Question": "What are some indicators of greed as outlined in the passage?", "Answer": "These  verses  sound  counterintuitive  to  us.  We  think  that  holding  on  to  our money and stuff will mean that we have more of it, but the Bible says hoarding what  you  have  does  not  mean  more;  it  means  less.  While  it  may  seem counterintuitive,  we  can  observe  this  truth  in  nature.  Generously  sowing  seed and  generously  watering  the  ground  will  lead  to  much  fruit  (Murphy  and Huwiler,  Proverbs,  56).  Therefore,  one  major  sign  of  greed  is  hoarding  and stinginess, and that hurts you and others around you. "}
{"Question": "What advice does the text offer regarding the pursuit of material wealth?", "Answer": "Don't wear yourself out to get rich; because you know better, stop! As soon as your eyes fly to it, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky. "}
{"Question": "What lesson can be derived from the metaphor of wealth having wings and flying away like an eagle?", "Answer": "Don't wear yourself out to get rich; because you know better, stop!

{"Question": "How did Jon and his wife help nurture the caterpillars into butterflies?", "Answer": "Once  my  wife  and  I  (  Jon)  bought  our  daughters  butterflies  to  raise.  We  got them as caterpillars and tended to them and nurtured them until they grew to be butterflies in a net, but at some point we had to let them go.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs 28:25 highlight the link between greed and a lack of trust in God?", "Answer": "We  see  the  contrast  between  greed  and  belief  again  in  Proverbs  28:25:  \"A greedy  person  stirs  up  conflict,  but  whoever  trusts  in  the  LORD  will  prosper.\" Here's  the  bottom  line:  those  who  are  greedy  do  not  trust  God.  They  trust  in money instead  of Jesus. That reality is why  Jesus said that it is hard for a  rich man to enter the kingdom of God (Matt 19:23). The rich do not see their need for God.  In  contrast,  those  who  trust  the  Lord  are  content,  they  do  not  grasp  for other things to make them happy, and they wait for the true blessings that come from God alone. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs link foolishness with idolatry, especially in the context of greed?", "Answer": "Here's  the  bottom  line:  greed  is  a  belief  and  worship  issue.  You  believe  and worship your way into greed, and you must believe and worship your way out of it.  It's  not  just  that  greed  makes  you  a  Mr.  Scrooge;  it's  that  greed  shows  that you  are  walking  away  from  Jesus,  the  Wisdom  of  God.  Proverbs  reveals  that foolishness is idolatry, and thus the foolishness of greed reveals a heart that does not believe or follow Jesus. "}
{"Question": "In what way did Jesus demonstrate his prioritization of eternal rewards over temporary pleasures?", "Answer": "Jesus perfectly avoided greed; he was never greedy, even one time. Satan tried to bribe Jesus with the kingdoms of the world if he would bypass the cross and its  suffering,  but  Jesus  perfectly  controlled  his  appetite  and  refused  idolatry. Everything he refused from Satan-and more-was given to him by God later. After all, after his resurrection from the dead he looked at his disciples and said, \"All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth\" (Matt 28:18). Jesus refused the fleeting pleasures of this life so that he could enjoy eternal ones. He knew what we do not seem to understand-our cravings will never be satisfied in this life. Man does not live by bread or flat screen TV alone; he lives by God alone (Matt 4:4). "}
{"Question": "What is emphasized about contentment in the context of one's identity as a believer in Jesus?", "Answer": "Jesus,  through  his  death,  provides  forgiveness  and  salvation  to  those  who repent  of  greed  and  believe  in  him.  He  also  grants  his  perfect  record  of contentment  to  those  who  believe  in  him.  If  you  are  in  Christ,  this  is  who  you are: the perfectly content son or daughter of God. Now live like it! "}

{"Question": "What transformation occurs in the identity of individuals who truly believe in Jesus?", "Answer": "Jesus,  through  his  death,  provides  forgiveness  and  salvation  to  those  who repent  of  greed  and  believe  in  him.

Now live like it! "}
{"Question": "How does the emphasis on spiritual support contrast with material concerns like the love of money?", "Answer": "Keep your life free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for he himself has said, I will never leave you or abandon you. Therefore, we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? "}
{"Question": "How does Philippians 4:19 frame the idea of trusting God for one's needs?", "Answer": "If you are not content, it is because you do not trust God to help you. This is a belief issue. You do not trust that your God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus (Phil 4:19). But when you place your trust in God and find your satisfaction in him alone, you can be content with what you have and praise God for what he has given you. "}
{"Question": "How does understanding the grace of Jesus Christ lead to a transformation from greed to generosity?", "Answer": "Not  only  does  the  gospel  lead  you  to  be  content  with  what  you  have,  it  also leads you to be generous toward others. Second Corinthians 8:9 says, \"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.\" The gospel turns us from takers and hoarders into generous and joyful givers because what we have in Christ is vastly superior to material riches. When God got hold of my dad, he (Danny) sold his car to give more money to the church. You do not have to be rich to be generous; you just have to be changed by Jesus. I remember leading a young couple to the Lord who had nothing and barely scraped by, but they gave away their crib and some baby clothes to help other people. Once you grasp the gospel  of  Jesus  leaving  his  throne  in  heaven,  then  you  can  let  go  of  the  things you hold so dear and give them to others generously. "}
{"Question": "How do seemingly insignificant actions today lead to potential destruction in the future?", "Answer": "Some people do not see how right now they are taking small steps in this area that  will  ultimately  destroy  their  life.  Some  are  training  themselves  for destruction right now and think it is no big deal. They think to themselves things like, \"I just look at porn occasionally.\" \"It's not hurting anyone.\" \"I don't have a problem.\" \"What's the big deal if I make out with my girlfriend?\" \"What's the big  deal  in  giving  an  iPhone  to  my  twelve-year-old?\"  Some  folks  are  setting patterns in their lives right now-or in the lives of their children-that will cause them to do something one year, three years, or fifteen years from now that their children will remember at a funeral service. "}
{"Question": "What role does the purity of one's heart play in preventing the manifestation of sinful desires?", "Answer": "The sage says, \"My son, give me your heart,\" because he knows-like Jesus- that  lust  starts  in  the  heart.  Purity  of  heart  is  the  goal  because  it  will  lead  to  a pure  life.  As  Proverbs  4:23  has  already  told  us,  your  heart  determines  your behavior, so you cannot simply modify your behavior. If you are not pure at the heart level, you will find new outlets for your sin. For example, without a pure heart, you might put blocking software on your computer, but you will find ways around  it,  or  you  will  just  fantasize  in  your  own  mind.  The  battle  against  lust must be fought in the mind and heart because that is where this all starts. That is its origin. "}
{"Question": "How does the sage link a lustful heart to the act of looking at inappropriate things?", "Answer": "Then  the  sage  moves  from  the  heart  to  the  eyes  because  a  lustful  heart  will drive  eyes  to  look  at  things  they  should  not  look  at.  We  cannot  tell  you  how many  people  are  killing  themselves  with  pornography.  They  are  warping  their minds to view sexuality in a purely selfish and corrupt manner. This selfish view of sex destroys marriages and will destroy future marriages because the viewer's mind is twisted by pornographic images into seeing intimacy as something other than what it is, something other than God designed and intended. Looking at all kinds  of  things  can  drive  lust:  Internet  porn,  the  wrong  movies,  the  wrong sitcoms,  the  Sports  Illustrated  swimsuit  edition,  or  just  checking  out  women  at  the mall. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs use the concept of the pit as a metaphor for both physical and spiritual demise?", "Answer": "Also,  the  pit  is  a  metaphor  for  physical  and  spiritual  death.  Proverbs  talks about Sheol, or the grave, when it talks about the pit (Prov 5; 7; 9). Sexual lust will  send  you  to  hell.  Sexual  sin  and  lust  is  an  enemy.  Lust  is  a  huntress  or robber who wants to kill you and take everything you have. Just like the hunter's prey, you often do not see the trap until it is too late. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs warn against the dangers of succumbing to sexual lust and desire?", "Answer": "Also,  the  pit  is  a  metaphor  for  physical  and  spiritual  death.

{"Question": "How does Proverbs distinguish between wisdom as a person and wisdom as a set of ideas?", "Answer": "Proverbs has told us repeatedly that wisdom is not a set of ideas; Wisdom is a person. And the New Testament tells us that person is Jesus. But Proverbs also reveals that Folly is a person. Satan stands behind the wayward woman-sexual sin-seeking to kill you. The enemy is prowling around setting a trap to destroy you and take you to hell. How does he do it? He does it through things that are seductive and appealing. Satan is tracking you down, and he notices the things that turn you on, just as a hunter notices what bait attracts the deer. "}

{"Question": "What warning does verse 28 offer to individuals who engage in unfaithful behavior due to lust?", "Answer": "Lust traps you and ruins your life. It is a waste of time and resources. It warps your idea of marriage. And it puts in place a pattern of behavior that in the future will cause you to hurt your spouse and betray your family. That is what verse 28 says.  The  predator  increases  the  number  of  unfaithful  people.  So  lust  will  ruin you. It will damage your reputation, or it will cause you to lose your family or your  future  family.  Sexual  sin  is  a  break  of  the  marriage  covenant,  even  your future marriage covenant. Goldsworthy points out that this verse refers to those who are unfaithful in marriage (Tree of Life, 155). "}
{"Question": "How does the sage characterize sexual sin, and why does he liken it to a pit?", "Answer": "The sage says that sexual sin is a pit. He said it earlier about the adulteress's mouth in 22:14: \"The mouth of the forbidden woman is a deep pit; a man cursed by the LORD will fall into it.\" What does this refer to? The mouth is what often leads men and women astray (cf. Prov 5; 7). Flattery appeals to a man's vanity (Longman,  Proverbs,  408),  and  words  appeal  to  a  woman's  desire  for  intimate conversation. Sexual sin offers you pleasure, and it delivers for a little while. But then you realize too late that you fell into a trap. After all, Proverbs 7 and 9 say this woman's house leads down to the grave. "}
{"Question": "How does the departure of God's mercy exacerbate the impact of succumbing to fleshly desires?", "Answer": "Interestingly, falling for this kind of sin will not just earn you future judgment; it is a sign of God's condemnation right now (22:14). A sign of God's judgment is  the  fact  that  he  is  handing  you  over  to  your  fleshly  desires.  He  removes  his merciful, restraining hand from you. Not being able to control yourself, loathing yourself  because  one  more  time  you  have  deleted  the  Internet  history  on  your computer,  losing  your  family  because  of  pornography  addiction-these  are  all just a foretaste of the judgment that is to come. "}
{"Question": "How do subtle actions that may seem harmless gradually erode the foundation of a marriage?", "Answer": "The  problem  is  that  we  are  all  predisposed  to  this  and  have  fallen  short  of God's glory in this area. It starts out small and sometimes seemingly innocent, but then BAM! you fall. All along you did not see how you were undermining your  marriage  or  your  future  marriage.  You  thought  it  was  harmless.  You thought you had not really done anything \"sinful,\" but you did not see how you were  driving  a  wedge  into  your  marriage.  You  thought  things  like,  \"It's  just  a little flirting. So what? He makes me feel appreciated in a way I don't at home.\" \"What's the big deal? I'd never really do anything anyway.\" \"She laughs at my jokes.\"  \"He's  a  better  listener  than  my  husband.\"  Those  thoughts,  even unconsciously, plant a deadly germ in your marriage. "}
{"Question": "How does the Bible characterize the consequences of engaging in sexual immorality?", "Answer": "We try to downplay and justify our lust and our sexual sin, but the Bible says they are deadly. The sexually immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God. So the  question  asked  by  Tim  Challies  is  a  good  one:  \"Do  you  love  pornography enough to go to hell for it?\" (\"Desecration and Titillation\"). And we might add, Do you love lust enough to go to hell for it? "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs suggest that marriage can serve as a solution to the issue of lust?", "Answer": "Therefore,  Proverbs  tells  us  that  the  horizontal  antidote  to  lust  is  marriage. Enjoy  exclusive  and  repeated  intimacy  with  your  spouse  rather  than  burn  with lust. So guys, romance your wife, learn about her, become an expert on her, do getaway weekends without the kids, do not sleep in separate rooms, and pursue her your entire life. If you are not regularly intimate with your wife, Paul says you are  in  a  danger  zone.  After  all,  he  mentions  the  same  predators  seeking  to destroy marriage as Proverbs (1 Cor 7). "}
{"Question": "What actions does the text recommend for maintaining intimacy and connection with one's spouse?", "Answer": "Therefore,  Proverbs  tells  us  that  the  horizontal  antidote  to  lust  is  marriage.

{"Question": "What metaphor does the text use to illustrate the threat of succumbing to lustful desires?", "Answer": "The sage warns us through the Spirit about lust, and we are called to heed the warnings and walk in wisdom-following after Jesus. That means gouging out your eye instead of going to hell (Matt 5:29). Flee from lust and do not even get close  to  it  because  it  is  so  dangerous.  Do  not  see  how  far  you  can  go  or  how close  you  can  get  to  the  line.  Do  not  ask,  \"How  close  to  immorality  can  I  get without actually committing it?\" No! Run from it (1 Cor 6:18)! This might mean a community group where you are accountable to other guys, blocking software, joining a reporting program like Covenant Eyes, getting rid of your computer, or throwing your kids' iPhone in the trash. It means doing whatever you have to do. You might say, \"Oh that's a bit much,\" but not if you look at it this way: there is a  ferocious  predator  loose  in  your  house  trying  to  kill  you,  and  it  only  makes sense to take drastic measures to take its life before it takes yours. "}
{"Question": "In what contexts, as discussed in the text, is the advice to \"follow your heart\" commonly applied?", "Answer": "T he prevailing idea of our pop culture is \"Follow your heart, and you can't go  wrong.\"  From  Disney  movies  to  The  Bachelor,  we  are  told  to  follow  our hearts  in  order  to  make  the  best  decisions  for  our  lives.  Whom  should  I  date? Whom  should  I  marry?  Should  I  stay  married?  What  career  path  should  I choose? To answer those kinds of questions, you just need to ask, What does my heart tell me? Even \"Christian\" counsel often seems to be a mix of Bible verses and \"follow your heart.\" Be true to you, or be true to who God made you to be- however you might define that-and things will always work out. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 28:26 caution against blindly trusting one's own heart without wisdom?", "Answer": "The  world  calls  us  to  pride  and  self-exaltation,  but  the  Bible  warns  us  about these  companion  sins.  While  the  Disney  Channel  tells  you  to  rely  on  yourself and  follow  your  heart,  the  Bible  says  that  is  foolishness.  Proverbs  28:26  says, \"Whoever trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered\" (author's translation). The reason it is wrong to pridefully follow your heart is because your heart is sinful. Proverbs 20:9 asks, \"Who can say, â€˜I have kept  my  heart  pure;  I  am  cleansed  from  my  sin'?\"  The  rhetorical  question  is posed in such a way that the expected answer is, no one! (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31,  135).  Because  of  our  sinful  and  impure  condition,  we  do  not  choose rightly.  We  do  not  see  things  clearly,  and  therefore  following  our  hearts  is deadly  because  we  will  not  be  \"delivered\"  (i.e.,  saved).  A  pride  that  thinks  we are always right and does not see things for the way they really are is a deadly thing. "}
{"Question": "In what way does the author equate colorblindness with the concept of foolishness?", "Answer": "Foolishness is a lot like colorblindness, and I know a lot about colorblindness because  I  (  Jon)  am  struck  with  this  malady.  At  my  house,  one  of  our  girls' favorite  games  is  to  hold  up  items  and  ask  daddy,  \"What  color  is  this?\"  while they  giggle  uncontrollably  when  I  cannot  answer!  I  cannot  see  colors  rightly (neither can two of my brothers)-they look different to me than to most people. Proverbs says that is how foolishness is. You are not able to see things the way they really are. You cannot perceive the right order of things. For example, all of us have watched movies or sitcoms on network TV that our grandparents would have  considered  hardcore  pornography.  We  don't  consider  them  hardcore because we have grown up in a culture where seeing skin, lots of skin, does not shock us (Moore, Walking the Line). We are self-deceived and cannot see that we are thinking  wrongly;  so  we  go  against  the  grain  of  how  God  designed  the  world, and we hurt ourselves and often others as well. "}
{"Question": "In what way does Solomon define the fear of the Lord as a fundamental aspect of wisdom in Proverbs?", "Answer": "Proverbs as a whole, and Proverbs 16 in particular, tells us that wisdom is found in  humbly  trusting  God.  After  all,  he  made  the  world,  and  he  knows  how  it works. Proverbs encourages us to look to God and his Word for wisdom. If one were to boil down the message of Proverbs, it might look like this: \"Trust God, not yourself!\" Or \"Be humble, not prideful.\" This is what Solomon means when he  says  that  the  fear  of  the  Lord  is  the  key  component  to  wisdom  (1:7;  9:10; etc.). What does that mean? It means that there are two components to gaining wisdom: humbly look away from yourself, and look to God and his Word. The fear  of  Yahweh  is  reverent  awe  and  dependence  on  him-as  he  has  revealed himself  in  his  Word-that  leads  to  obeying  him.  This  is  a  healthy  fear  of  him who can cast both soul and body into hell (Matt 10:28). True wisdom entails the humility to know that you do not know it all! "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of humility contribute to the acquisition of wisdom in Proverbs?", "Answer": "So if the boiled-down message of Proverbs is to trust God with all your heart and  not  lean  on  your  own  understanding,  then  this  requires  humility,  which  is almost  synonymous  in  Proverbs  with  the  fear  of  Yahweh  (see  15:31-33).  The first  step  to  wisdom  is  to  realize  that  you  are  not  wise.  In  order  to  have knowledge, you  must  first  recognize  that  you  do  not  know  everything  and  you are  not  always  right.  Wisdom  is  being  humble  enough  to  admit  that,  and  then submitting  yourself  to  God  and  wise  counsel.  Proverbs  9:8-10  says  that  when you correct a wise man he will be wiser still. This means that you never arrive at the  point  where  you  are  so  wise  that  you  do  not  need  to  humble  yourself  to correction. On the other hand, pride is the essence of foolishness in many ways. Proverbs  11:2  states,  \"When  arrogance  comes,  disgrace  follows;  but  with humility  comes  wisdom,\"  and  Proverbs  16:18-20  explains  that  \"Pride  comes before destruction . . . and the one who trusts in the LORD will be happy.\" "}
{"Question": "Why is it emphasized that wisdom comes from God's word and mouth in the context of fearing Him?", "Answer": "The fear of Yahweh and the knowledge of God seem to be parallel concepts (2:5).  The  bottom  line  is  that  a  personal  relationship  with  God  is  the  key  to wisdom. We fear him because he is the one who gives wisdom-it comes from his mouth, which also points us to the Word of God (2:6; cf. 30:5-6). In order to fear God and be wise, we must go to his Word and submit to its authority for our lives. "}
{"Question": "How does trusting God and his Word impact one's life according to Proverbs 28:14?", "Answer": "Trusting  God  and  his  Word  brings  life.  Proverbs  28:14  states,  \"Happy  is  the one who is always reverent, but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.\" So there is blessing if you fear Yahweh, but if you reject him it will be disastrous. Trusting  the  Lord  prolongs  life,  whereas  folly  can  ruin  your  life  or  lead  to  a premature  death  (Fox,  Proverbs  1-9,  143).  Trusting  Yahweh  has  positive consequences  on  the  family  because  it  gives  your  children  a  refuge  (14:26).  It leads  to  not  having  anxiety  because  you  are  satisfied  in  the  Lord  (19:23). Trusting Yahweh leads to a good reputation, joy in life now, and eternal life in the  age  to  come.  So  recognize  that  prideful  insistence  that  you  always  know what is right is actually wrong, and humbly submit yourself to the Lord! "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs suggest that godly wisdom is transmitted to individuals?", "Answer": "Proverbs  tells  its  reader  that  godly  wisdom  is  often  mediated  through  human agents like parents. But it could also be applied to counselors, authority figures, or pastors. Foolishness means not submitting to these agents because you do not think  that  you  need  to,  because  in  your  pride  you  think  you  are  always  right. Wisdom means submitting to godly counsel that accords with the Word of God. You humbly submit to it because you know that you need it, need to learn more, and  need  to  learn  from  your  mistakes.  Proverbs  10:8  states,  \"A  wise  heart accepts commands, but foolish lips will be destroyed.\" One must recognize that correction is in your best interest, and that it is not in your self-interest to ignore counsel (though many if not most people act as though it is). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs emphasize the importance of respecting and obeying parental authority?", "Answer": "The first place that a person is called to submit humbly is to their parents, as if they  are  obeying  the  Lord  himself  (1:8;  2:1;  3:1;  4:1,10;  etc.  cf.  Eph  6:1-2). Proverbs 13:1 says, \"A wise son responds to his father's discipline, but a mocker doesn't  listen  to  rebuke.\"  God  has  placed  this  authority  in  your  life  for  your good.  Wise  children  will  recognize  that  and  submit  to  their  parents'  authority, while  fools  will  refuse  to  listen  to  their  parents.  Fools  think  their  parents  are unwise  and  outdated,  but  you  will  learn  one  day  just  how  foolish  that  is.  The following  is  attributed  to  Mark  Twain,  although  its  provenance  is  unclear: \"When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\" "}
{"Question": "What lesson about parental wisdom is conveyed through the Mark Twain quote shared in the text?", "Answer": "The first place that a person is called to submit humbly is to their parents, as if they  are  obeying  the  Lord  himself  (1:8;  2:1;  3:1;  4:1,10;  etc.  cf.

{"Question": "How does the act of humility and submission to God's will align with the concept of wisdom?", "Answer": "But there is one man who did not give in to the temptation in the garden. He said  in  his  garden,  \"Not  what  I  want  but  what  you  want,\"  and  he  went  to  the cross. First Corinthians 1 tells us that act was foolishness to the world, but it's the  wisdom  and  power  of  God.  If  we  are  going  to  be  wise  in  God's  eyes,  that will  mean  looking  strange  in  the  eyes  of  the  world.  And  if  we  are  going  to  be wise,  that  means  humble  submission  to  the  one  who  is  God's  wisdom  and sanctification  for  us.  It  will  mean  having  the  mind  of  Jesus,  who  humbled himself  to  the  point  of  death-even  to  death  on  a  cross  (Phil  2:5-11).  So  fear Jesus and humbly walk in wisdom! "}
{"Question": "How does the concept of work in the context of marriage tie into one's spiritual journey?", "Answer": "I n  a  song  titled  \"Down  the  Road\"  by  Mac  McAnally,  Kenny  Chesney  sings about a boy wanting to marry a girl and go through life together. In the third verse,  her  mother  wonders  if  the  boy  is  a  genuine  Christian,  but  her  father worries whether the boy has a good enough job to make it through married life. We hear that and think those are two very different concerns: Momma's is a very spiritual  (and  godly)  concern,  whereas  Daddy's  is  merely  a  material  concern. Wrong! Wanting to know if a man has a good enough work ethic to provide for your daughter is a very spiritual concern according to the Bible. Work is not a secular or neutral matter; it has everything to do with your walk with Christ! "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs depict the issue of laziness as both a character flaw and a spiritual concern?", "Answer": "Proverbs says that sloth-laziness-is not just a character flaw, although it is. Proverbs mocks lazy people repeatedly as those who can't even bring their food to  their  mouths.  But  Proverbs  also  says  that  laziness  is  a  spiritual  problem! Proverbs warns the lazy and thereby calls them to repentance. "}

{"Question": "What do the conditions observed in the field and vineyard of the slacker signify in the text?", "Answer": "I went by the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of one lacking sense. Thistles had come up everywhere, weeds covered the ground, and the stone wall was ruined. I saw, and took it to heart; I looked, and received instruction: a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest, and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need, like a bandit. (24:30-34) "}
{"Question": "What characterizes the attitude of someone labeled as a \"slacker\" in the text?", "Answer": "Often, our sinful reaction to the curse is to take on as little responsibility as we can.  Many  become  couch  potatoes  or  lack  the  drive  to  work  hard.  The  slacker gives in to this temptation. He is not sweating, and he is not providing. He just lets the weeds grow and allows things to fall apart. "}
{"Question": "What advice does the text give regarding the appropriate balance between rest and work?", "Answer": "Some people have a problem not prioritizing what needs to be done over what we want to do! That's laziness too. This type of slothfulness is choosing to do what you want to do over what you need to do. Others have a life that is a mess because they are not taking control. They have a cluttered workspace and a car full  of  old  fast  food  wrappers.  Others  just  love  to  sleep  too  much.  That  is  a temptation for all of us because the God-ordained rhythm of work and rest can be abused. So get out of bed and get to work. "}
{"Question": "What advice does Proverbs 14:23 offer regarding the relationship between hard work and success?", "Answer": "Some people just constantly procrastinate at work. They start assignments the day  before  they  are  due.  They  repeatedly  put  things  off  to  another  day. Procrastination  is  sloth.  Some  people  are  all  talk  and  little  action.  They  go  to meetings and make big plans, but they do not follow through in the end. It is the husband who constantly says to his wife, \"I'll fix that,\" but never gets around to it. Proverbs 14:23 says of this kind of laziness, \"There is profit in all hard work, but endless talk leads only to poverty.\" Do not say you will do something if you won't! "}
{"Question": "What comparison does Proverbs 26:16 make regarding the perception of laziness and wisdom?", "Answer": "I ( Jon) understand this. I used to get up at 4 a.m. to run with my youth pastor, but I would love the mornings it rained because it gave me an excuse not to run. It was the best of all worlds because I did not feel guilty about bailing, since \"I can't  do  it  today  anyway.\"  But  I  could  have  gone  to  the  gym  instead!  It  is  the same with excuses for work. People who ask for benevolence help often tell me, \"I'll do any job that's available. I just want to work.\" Then I say, \"OK. I know the  manager  at  the  grocery  store  over  on  Main.  I  can  get  you  a  job  tomorrow stocking shelves.\" Then they will say, \"Oh, I can't do that because I have a back problem.\" They say that they will do anything, but unless it is a desk job making sixty thousand dollars a year with full benefits, they shoot down every job idea I give them. That is an excuse to not work! The best scenario (in our own minds) is  to  be  able  to  convince  ourselves  that  we  are  hard  workers  without  having actually to expend the energy to be a hard worker. That is why Proverbs 26:16 says, \"In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser than seven who can answer sensibly.\" That is one of the keys about being lazy-you often do not know or think that you are! You think you are a hard worker when actually you are not. "}
{"Question": "In what ways does Proverbs 21:25 warn against the fatal consequences of being a slacker?", "Answer": "Laziness is a destructive path not just because it will embarrass you, although it  will,  and  not  just  because  it'll  make  it  difficult  for  you  to  give  your  family what they need, although it will, and not just because it'll make you a drain on the  people  around  you,  although  it  will  (10:26);  it  is  destructive  because ultimately it will send you to hell. The wages of laziness is death. The desire for ease, comfort, and avoiding work kills you. Proverbs 21:25 states, \"A slacker's craving will kill him because his hands refuse to work.\" Again, it may not turn out  that  way  immediately  because  some  lazy  people  inherit  wealth,  but  it  will turn out that way ultimately. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 15:19 contrast the paths of the slacker and the upright?", "Answer": "Proverbs 15:19 says, \"A slacker's way is like a thorny hedge, but the path of the  upright  is  a  highway.\"  Again,  it  is  not  just  that  you  will  have  difficulty making your way in this life as a lazy person, although you will; but according to Proverbs there are two paths that lead to two different destinations. One leads to life  and  the  other  to  death,  and  laziness  is  the  path  to  hell.  Proverbs  18:9  says literally  that  a  lazy  person  is  a  brother  to  the  \"master  of  destruction,\"  so  you show  yourself  to  be  Satan's  brother  if  you  are  lazy.  Therefore,  judgment  will fall. Sloth is not just ridiculous; it is destructive! "}

{"Question": "What consequences does Paul outline in 2 Thessalonians 3:10 for those who refuse to work?", "Answer": "Our Laziness Points Us to Jesus Laziness  can  be  a  sign  of  not  being  born  again-lacking  the  new  heart-and needing to be transformed. This is why Paul says to deal with this in the church: if you don't work, you don't eat (2 Thess 3:10). And Paul says in 1 Timothy 5:8, \"But  if  anyone  does  not  provide  for  his  own  family,  especially  for  his  own household, he  has  denied  the faith  and is  worse than  an  unbeliever.\"  If  you  do not  have  a  work  ethic,  there  is  no  evidence  that  your  faith  is  real;  you  are  not believing the gospel. You may get up early, sit in your favorite chair, and read Scripture  for  an  hour,  but  if  you  constantly  procrastinate  on  your  work assignments or cannot complete tasks that are assigned to you, then you have a problem  with  Jesus  no  matter  how  long  your  quiet  time  is!  (Moore,  \"Finding Jesus\"). "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs 12:24 emphasize the relationship between a good work ethic and leadership roles?", "Answer": "Work ethic is important for all kinds of reasons, and one reason is what God is preparing you for. Proverbs 12:24 says, \"The diligent hand will rule, but laziness will lead to forced labor.\" This does not just mean that you will be promoted if you work hard, though it is more likely you will. Humanity was called to rule the creation in the beginning, but we handed it over to the serpent. Solomon tells his son-a  son  who  will  rule  Israel-a  good  work  ethic  is  necessary  to  rule.  This principle  is  fulfilled  in  the  Greater  Solomon  who  rules  not  only  Israel  but  the whole world. He regains what was lost in Eden, and one day his kingdom will cover the entire cosmos. Jesus says that those who are faithful in the small things will be put in charge of many things (Matt 25). He says his followers will rule the universe with him, but in order to do that we are called to be faithful in the seemingly mundane things. As Russell Moore says, \"We are in an internship for the eschaton right now\" (\"Finding Jesus\").44 As you change diapers, take out the trash, carry out the project assigned by your boss, deliver the package, and paint the wall, you are being prepared to be a king or queen of the universe.

That  is why revenge stories and songs are so popular. I cannot help but smile when the Count  of  Monte  Cristo  coldly  pays  back  everyone  who  did  him  wrong.  People are  fascinated  by  shows  like  Maury  Povich's  when  he  brings  out  high  school nerds who are now good-looking and jacked with muscles to show off to those who  used  to  pick  on  them.  People  love  listening  to  songs  like  Carrie Underwood's  \"Before  He  Cheats,\"  or  \"Two  Black  Cadillacs,\"  or  Toby  Keith's \"How Do You Like Me Now?\" Keith sings about someone who made fun of him in  high  school  but  now  wakes  up  to  an  alarm  in  the  morning  hearing  Keith's song on the radio.

{"Question": "How does the human inclination towards revenge tie into the fundamental concept of justice?", "Answer": "Since we all know what it is like to be wronged or for someone we love to be wronged, we all love the revenge story. There is a sense in which we should love these stories: we are born with an innate sense of justice because we have been made in the image of a God who is just. That is why we get really angry when people get away with doing what is wrong or get off on a technicality, especially if  it  is  someone  we  love  who  was  hurt.  We  want  the  offender  to  get  what  is coming to him. We want justice to be done! "}

{"Question": "What is the core problem identified in the text regarding the human desire for justice?", "Answer": "Since  we  are  made  in  the  image  of  a  God  who  is  just,  and  since  wanting justice to be done  is not wrong,  why does God condemn wrath and  bitterness? The  problem  we  have  is  not  the  desire  for  justice  to  be  done.  The  problem  we have is the desire to be the ones who execute the justice, when that job belongs to God alone. Our sense of justice is right, but trying to be the one who executes it is wrong because it is an attempt to take God's place. When you refuse to lay down a grudge, you reveal that you do not trust that God is able to deal with an injustice to your satisfaction. We see this truth throughout the book of Proverbs. People are wrathful because they do not trust the wrath of God to make things right. "}
{"Question": "How does Proverbs emphasize the negative consequences of harboring hatred and anger?", "Answer": "Proverbs  10:12  says,  \"Hatred  stirs  up  conflicts,  but  love  covers  all  offenses.\" Therefore,  according  to  Proverbs,  being  a  wrathful,  vengeful,  bitter,  angry, quick-tempered,  unforgiving  person  is  the  path  of  foolishness.  In  contrast, wisdom means being a patient person who is slow to anger and quick to forgive (14:29).  Holding  on  to  grudges  and  seeking  to  get  even  are  condemned throughout the book. Forgiveness and mercy are encouraged. "}

{"Question": "What does Proverbs 17:9 convey about the impact of concealing offenses versus gossiping about them?", "Answer": "Proverbs  mentions  all  kinds  of  ways  people  try  to  get  even  that  do  not necessarily  include  violence.  Some  respond  to  an  insult  from  someone  else  by crafting  a  great  comeback.  Some  lash  out  by  gossiping  about  others.  For example,  in  one  of  Taylor  Swift's  songs  where  she  is  done  wrong  by  a boyfriend, she tells him that she will tell everyone else that he is gay. Proverbs calls  us  to  another  path.  Proverbs  17:9  says,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense promotes love, but whoever gossips about it separates friends.\" People try to get even  by  constantly  bringing  up  past  wrongs  done  to  them  and  refusing  to  let them  go.  Some  just  blow  up  in  a  fury  and  lose  their  temper  with  their  wife, husband,  or  children  by  saying  things  they  should  not  say  and  do  not  really mean.  It  damages  their  relationships  and  ability  to  share  intimacy.  Instead, Proverbs 17:27 urges, \"The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding.\" So instead of gossiping or losing our temper or making lists of wrongs done to us, we are called to be cool- headed and let go of offenses done to us! "}
{"Question": "In what way does Proverbs 20:22 caution against the harmful intentions that originate in the heart?", "Answer": "For some of us, we can ease any guilt we might feel over our bitterness with the fact that \"I never acted on it.\" But even if you never act on it, bitterness- which starts in the heart, in our thought life-is still sin. Further, what starts in the  heart  may  not  stay  in  the  heart.  Proverbs  20:22  states,  \"Don't  say,  â€˜I  will avenge  this  evil!'  Wait  on  the  LORD,  and  he  will  rescue  you.\"  The  verse references talking to yourself-planning that starts in the heart. The intent to get even starts in the heart, and is accountable to God, even if you never act on it. Jesus says the same thing in Matthew 5! "}
{"Question": "How does the suffering of Christ serve as a model for those who are called to follow him?", "Answer": "For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps. He did not commit sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth; when he was insulted, he did not insult in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. (1 Pet 2:21-23) "}
{"Question": "How do these verses address the challenge of forgiving those who have wronged us?", "Answer": "These verses answer the big practical question that hurt people have: How can I forgive? How can I let it go? How can I act like nothing really happened to me while they get away scot-free? The answer to that question is follow the example of Jesus and hand justice over to God!

{"Question": "How do personal narratives and lived experiences shape an individual's perspective on forgiveness?", "Answer": "People  believe  that  forgiveness  is  the  right  course  of  action  in  every  case  with one exception-mine! Our hearts are warmed by forgiveness stories, but we all think  that  our  situation  is  just  a  little  bit  different.  We  think,  You  could  not  possibly expect me to forgive him or her after what he or she did to me. How can I forgive a father who killed my mother, a dad who took advantage of me, or a spouse who walked out on me? "}

{"Question": "How does the biblical verse in Proverbs 20:22 caution against seeking personal vengeance?", "Answer": "Proverbs 20:22 states, \"Don't say, â€˜I will avenge this evil!' Wait on the LORD, and he will rescue you.\" The Bible calls us away from vigilante or self-produced justice. People resonate with vigilantes like Zorro, Batman, Dexter, or the Count of  Monte  Christo  because  we  want  justice  to  be  done.  But  these  stories  are stories of unbelief. Real forgiveness is a belief issue. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and it is still the beginning of wisdom when it comes to bitterness and forgiveness. You trust God to redress what has happened to you. You free yourself of bitterness by trusting that God will avenge you. In Romans 12:19  the  Lord  says,  \"Vengeance  is  mine.  I  will  repay\"  (author's  translation). There is no timetable given, but there is certainty that it will happen. No matter how long it takes, you trust that God will set things right in the end.

{"Question": "How does preaching the gospel to oneself help in managing anger and promoting forgiveness?", "Answer": "Therefore, let go of your grudges, forgive those who hurt you, pray for those who  have  wronged  you,  do  good  to  your  enemy,  and  do  not  insist  on  always having  the  last  word.  The  way  you  live  that  kind  of  life  is  by  constantly preaching  the  gospel  to  yourself  in  those  moments  when  your  anger  begins  to simmer and seethe. It may be that your mercy leads to the salvation of the lost because  they  see  the  gospel  in  your  kindness  in  a  way  they  could  never  see  it before. If the world began to see Christians who forgive one another and do not retaliate when made fun of by the world, then just maybe they will start to see the wisdom of God in the foolishness of the cross. When they see crazy people who  forgive  drunk  drivers  who  killed  their  children  or  a  wife  who  forgives terrorists who gunned down her missionary husband, then maybe they will start to see Jesus. Until then, they see people who are just like them. After all, Jesus says even lost people do good to those who are good to them (Matt 5:43-47). "}
{"Question": "How does Peter's encounter with Jesus in John 18 exemplify the concept of trust in God's justice?", "Answer": "Conclusion How do we do good to those who hurt us? Peter echoes the words of Proverbs when he tells us to follow Jesus who trusted in the justice of God (1 Pet 2:18- 25).  Peter  saw  this  firsthand  (  John  18).  When  the  mob  came  for  Jesus,  Peter took up his sword and cut off a man's ear. Jesus told Peter to put the sword away because he did not need Peter's help. Jesus could call the armies of heaven and they would respond to his voice, but Jesus was able to be non-wrathful because he  knew  God's  wrath  needed  to  come  down  and  be  poured  out  on  him  at Golgotha. And Jesus knew that one day he would split the eastern sky and return to exact vengeance on all the enemies of God. Every injustice will be set right- bank on it! On that day he will not need your help or my help. As Russell Moore says, \"He will say, â€˜No need for swords, boys. I can take it from here'\" (\"Why Jesus\"). "}
