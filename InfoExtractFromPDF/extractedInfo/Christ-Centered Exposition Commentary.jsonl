Wisdom is correction and understanding (1:2). C. Wisdom is the knowledge of good and evil (1:3). D. Wisdom is discernment (1:4). E. Wisdom is obtaining guidance (1:5-6). II. How Do You Get Wisdom (1:7)? A. You get wisdom by reverent trust in the Lord (1:7). P eople  desperately  want  to  \"win\"  at  life.  They  want  to  succeed  in  everyday life,  and  Christians  are  no  different.  They  search  frantically  for  tips  from books, from \"experts\" on TV talk shows, or in magazines. The problem is that many  Christians  look  everywhere  but  the  Bible  to  learn  how  to  \"win\"  at parenting, finances, marriage, the workplace, and other areas of life. They look to Dr. Phil or Oprah or Dear Abby or Delilah After Dark or Intelligence for Life by John Tesh. If you have to look to John Tesh for intelligence on life, you're in trouble! Even Christians who want a \"Christian\" perspective on these topics are more likely to look to a Christian book than to the Book-the Bible! So often we don't want  the  Word.  Instead,  we  want  practical  tips  and  strategies  that  have  been plucked  from  the  world.  Sure,  we  believe  the  Bible  is  God's  Word  and  it's authoritative,  but  we  somehow  buy  into  the  misconception  that  it  doesn't  do  a great job of addressing the nitty-gritty details of daily life. So Christians will do no more than skim the Word devotionally to get some helpful tips for their day. The philosophies of the world primarily shape and fashion their worldview. However,  the  problem  doesn't  stop  there.  The  problem  is  that  even  if  we  do look to the Book, and even if we do somehow pull out some tips for how to live a  better  life,  more  often  than  not  we  don't  follow  what  we  already  know. Oftentimes we know what to do, but we can't bring ourselves to do it. Think of how often we mess up. Think of the hurtful words you've said to a friend or your spouse  or  your  parents.  Think  of  the  times  you've  said  more  than  you  should "}

Think about that person whose feelings you hurt. Think about that lie you desperately hope your parents won't find out or your boyfriend won't find out or your wife won't  find  out.  Think  about  those  things  you  keep  hidden  from  your  parents. Think  about  that  time  you  screamed,  \"I  hate  you!\"  to  your  mom.  Think  about that secret that you just couldn't keep to yourself, and in a moment of supposed confidential privacy you whispered in someone's ear, \"Well, did you hear what happened  to  .  .  .  ?\"  Think  about  the  times  you've  bragged  about  yourself  so others  would  think  you're  something.  Think  about  the  mistakes  you've  made with your children. Think about the times you didn't discipline a behavior that has  now  gotten  out  of  hand.

Think about the times you've been stingy with your  money  instead  of  generous  to  a  person  with  a  real  need.  Think  about  the frivolous  spending  that  got  you  in  trouble.  Think  about  the  get-rich-quick scheme  that  ruined  you.  Think  about  the  times  you  didn't  finish  your  job assignment on time because you got sidetracked by Facebook. Think about the people  you're  jealous  of  because  they  got  the  promotion  that  passed  you  by. Think  about  the  times  you've  nagged  or  ignored  helping  your  spouse.  Think about  how  you  repeat  the  same  stupid  mistake  over  and  over  and  don't  learn from it. On and on and on we could go. What does all of this tell us? It tells us that we have a major problem that no amount of tips will solve. It tells us that we are not wise and are often foolish. It tells  us  that  we  are  broken  and  don't  work  right.  It  tells  us  that  we  are  in desperate need of wisdom to make decisions and navigate our way through life. But  we  can't  just  say  that  we  need  wisdom  and  then  go  after  it.  Since  we  are broken,  we  don't  even  follow  the  wisdom  we  already  know.  We  do  things  we know are hurtful and foolish. We just can't help ourselves. The  Bible  says  at  creation  there  was  perfect  harmony  between  people  and God,  between  people  themselves,  and  between  people  and  the  world  around them (Gen 1-2). There was an order to things. Human sin-the fall-broke all of that because people sought knowledge and wisdom apart from God (Gen 3). That messed everything up. Once a man's vertical relationship with God was out "}

Are  we  really  surprised  that  the  first  murder  in  history  (Gen  4) followed soon after the fall of humanity? Because  of  sin,  there  are  barriers  now  between  us  and  God,  between  us  and others, and between us and the world around us. We no longer rightly perceive the  way  the  world  works-we  no  longer  recognize  the  order-so  we  can't navigate  through  daily  life.  God  created  the  world  with  an  order  to  work  in  a certain  way,  and  we  must  live  according  to  that  to  be  truly  wise;  but  in  our brokenness we don't see it. Proverbs is all about restoring that harmony through Jesus Christ. Proverbs is all  about  becoming  wise  in  everyday  life  through  a  relationship  with  Jesus- through the gospel. It's about the life of the kingdom that God always meant for humankind  to  live.  When  our  vertical  relationship  with  God  is  right  through Jesus, we can be right with others and the world around us. What Is Wisdom? PROVERBS 1:1-6 Proverbs chapters 1-9 are the introduction to the book. It's a long introduction- like most preachers' sermons. Proverbs 1:1-7 is the preamble, the introduction to the  introduction.  This  section  tells  us  what  the  book  is  about  and  the  book's purpose. These are the \"proverbs\" (v. 1). The proverbs proper are the sentences of  wisdom  found  in  the  book.  Primarily  what  we  think  of  when  we  think  of \"proverbs\" are the short, pithy sayings contained in chapters 10-31. Proverbs 1- 9 sets those up and shows us how to interpret them. This word for \"proverbs\" in verse 1 of the LXX (the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Old Testament) is  a  word  sometimes  used  for  the  parables  of  Jesus  (e.g.,  John  10:6).  Indeed, Jesus is the one \"Greater than Solomon\" who instructs us in the wisdom of the kingdom. These  are  the  proverbs  \"of  Solomon\"  (v.  1).  Solomon  is  the  main  author  of Proverbs,  which  means  that  he  is  responsible  for  the  majority  of  it.  There  are other  authors  like  Agur  and  King  Lemuel,  but  it  should  be  no  shock  that Solomon  is  the  main  author.  Solomon  was  the  wisest  man  in  Israel's  history because the Lord granted him a wish for wisdom (1 Kgs 3). First Kings 4:30-34 states, Solomon's wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East, greater than all the wisdom of Egypt. He was wiser than anyone. . . . His reputation extended to all the surrounding nations. Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs numbered 1,005. He spoke about trees, from the "}
{"Page": 6, "Info": "cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He also spoke about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. Emissaries of all peoples, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to listen to Solomon's wisdom. There  are  basically  seven  divisions  in  the  book  of  Proverbs:  (1)  The Introduction (1:1-9:18); (2) Solomon's Proverbs (10:1-22:16); (3) The Sayings of  the  Wise  (22:17-24:22);  (4)  Further  Sayings  of  the  Wise  (24:23-34); (5)  Solomon's  Proverbs  Collected  by  Hezekiah's  Men  (25:1-29:27);  (6)  The Sayings  of  Agur  (30:1-33);  and  (7)  The  Sayings  of  King  Lemuel  (31:1-31) (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 4). Here, in the \"introduction to the introduction,\" Solomon tells us what wisdom is. Wisdom Is Royal (1:1) These are the proverbs of Solomon, \"son of David, king of Israel.\" Wisdom is royal because it's how kings rule their people. In 1 Kings 3:9 Solomon asks God for wisdom, which was for him the ability to rule well as king of Israel. He says, \"So  give  your  servant  a  receptive  heart  to  judge  your  people  and  to  discern between good and evil. For who is able to judge this great people of yours?\" And in Proverbs 8:15-16 Wisdom states, \"It is by me that kings reign and rulers enact just  law;  by  me,  princes  lead,  as  do  nobles  and  all  righteous  judges.\" Immediately Proverbs connects wisdom with the kingship and with the Messiah. \"Son  of  David\"  is  a  messianic  title.  The  Son  of  David  will  establish  God's eternal kingdom on earth, but he can only do it through wisdom-through justice (see 2 Sam 7; Isa 11). In Proverbs, Solomon is training his \"son\" in wisdom so that  he  can  establish  the  messianic  kingdom.  As  we  will  see,  he  is  also instructing the youth of the nation in wisdom in hopes of producing it in them as well. But the king embodies the nation and represents the nation. If the king is wise,  the  people  will  be  wise;  but  if  the  king  is  unwise,  the  people  will  be foolish. There is a need for a wise king who can produce a wise nation-a wise kingdom.  Throughout  Israel's  history  the  foolishness  of  the  kings  led  to  the difficulties and ultimately the destruction of the kingdom. The kings were fools, so the people were fools. As a result, there was death and chaos. What does this mean for us? We need to see that the Son of David-Jesus of Nazareth-has  established  the  messianic  kingdom  by  fulfilling  the  wisdom  of Proverbs. He is the wise Messiah promised in Isaiah 11 who will reestablish the harmony forfeited at the fall. We need to submit to his loving and wise rule so that he can produce wisdom in us. That's our only path to wisdom. Proverbs is laying  out  how  kingdom  citizens  should  live  and  what  the  wise  King  will "}
{"Page": 7, "Info": "produce  in  them.  Also,  in  the  consummated  kingdom  the  saints  of  Christ  will rule  the  cosmos  with  him  by  the  wisdom  of  God.  Therefore,  we  need  to  learn this wisdom so we can rule rightly. In the \"already\" of the kingdom seen in the church-the  outposts  of  the  kingdom-we  are  in  an  internship  for  eternity, ordered now by the wisdom of God. So  Solomon's  purpose  is  to  give  wisdom  in  order  to  bring  harmony  to  the kingdom. Proverbs 1:2 clearly states the purpose of the book-to impart wisdom to the reader. But what is wisdom besides the necessary means to rule? Solomon uses several words to help us grasp all that wisdom entails. Wisdom Is Correction and Understanding (1:2) Proverbs 1:2 says the purpose of the book is to know \"wisdom and discipline,\" or  \"understanding  and  correction.\"  Wisdom  is  the  kind  of  knowledge  that  helps you  know  what  is  going  on  around  you.  Are  you  able  to  read  situations  and people  correctly?  If  not,  you  need  discipline.1  This  requires  the  humility  to recognize that you don't know everything and to receive counsel from another. How do you respond to correction, to teaching, to counsel? That has a lot to do with whether or not you are wise. The know-it-all is not as wise as he thinks; the Bible says he's a fool. This  word  correction  or  discipline  entails  a  discipleship-type  relationship  where you  can  be  warned  about  going  in  the  wrong  direction,  rebuked  when  needed, corrected to go in a different way or to think differently, and punished if you do not listen. Do you have any relationship in your life right now where someone can correct you? Do you have any relationship in your life where someone can call  you  to  account  and  say,  \"What  do  you  think  you're  doing?\"  We  all  need pastors  or  parents  or  brothers  and  sisters  in  Christ  who  can  correct  us.  That's wisdom. Wisdom Is the Knowledge of Good and Evil (1:3) Solomon says that wisdom is ethical. He says the purpose of the book is for you as the reader to receive correction in order to be wise \"in righteousness, justice, and  integrity.\"  Therefore,  biblical  wisdom  is  not  intelligence  or  a  high  IQ;  it's the knowledge of good and evil. A wise person can tell the difference between right and wrong in the situations in which they find themselves. The problem for us is that even in the church we so often think of foolishness and wisdom as morally neutral. Pastors will even say things like being wise or foolish is not about right and wrong so much as best and not best. So foolishness is when I break my hand by slamming it on the floor because Tony Romo threw "}
{"Page": 8, "Info": "another interception to cost the Cowboys a playoff spot. That's not necessarily a sin;  it's  just  stupid,  a  pastor  will  say.  No!  That's  not  what  the  Bible  means  by wisdom and foolishness according to Proverbs 1:3. Foolishness lacks the ability to discern good and evil. It is a sin to be a fool. If I were to ask most people who on  the  sitcom  The  Simpsons  is  a  fool,  almost  everyone  who  has  ever  watched  it would say Bart because he does dumb things that get him in trouble. If I were to ask who is wise on The Simpsons, many would say Lisa because she has her head on straight. According to Proverbs, Lisa is just as foolish as Bart because she treats her parents like idiots. Folly is sinfulness and wisdom is righteousness according to Proverbs. Adam and Eve are prohibited access to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden. Why? God forbids them to eat that fruit not because he's giving them an arbitrary rule to break so that one day he can send his Son to die for sinners and save us from hell. He wants to teach humanity to depend on God for that knowledge instead of determining it for ourselves. God determines what  is  good  and  what  is  evil;  that's  not  for  us  to  decide.  So  we  fear  him  by submitting  to  his  Word.  However,  humans  decided  to  trust  the  voice  of  the serpent and what their \"own eyes\" said was best. Adam and Eve sought wisdom apart  from  God  and  his  Word.  That's  foolishness.  The  fruit  appeared  desirable \"to make one wise\"-it seemed right to them, but it was foolish, and foolishness according  to  Genesis  and  Proverbs  always  ends  in  death.  Wisdom  comes  from the mouth of God (Prov 2:6), so submit to the Word of God and not what you think is right. The  chaos  and  confusion  in  our  society  is  due  to  humankind  doing  what  is right in our own eyes rather than what God has revealed in his Word. That's not just true for those \"outsiders\" who reject a sanctity of life ethic and those who redefine marriage. Many of us in the church also have failed to submit to God's way. We agree that wisdom is to be found in God's Word. And we agree that we should submit to what it says in all things, except for our own situations, which for some reason we always think are the exceptions. \"I know God's Word says I have  no  grounds  for  a  divorce,  but  I  also  know  God  doesn't  want  me  to  be miserable.\" \"I know God's Word says I should submit to my husband, but you don't know my husband.\" \"I know God's Word says I should be generous, but I also know that God realizes I just don't have a lot right now.\" We find all kinds of  ways  to  evade  God's  Word  for  what  is  better  in  our  own  eyes.  That's foolishness. "}
{"Page": 9, "Info": "Instead, we need to submit to the wisdom-the knowledge of good and evil- that  God  gives  us  clearly  in  the  Word.  The  Lord  reveals  to  us  wisdom  in  his Word through the law. The law tells us right from wrong. Deuteronomy 4:6 says that Israel's wisdom is to be found in keeping the law. Parents are instructed to teach the law to their kids so that the nation can remain in the land and not die in exile (Deut 6). The king was to be a man of the law so that his kingdom would be  secure  (Deut  17).  In  the  book  of  Proverbs,  Solomon  is  obeying  both Deuteronomy 6 and 17 by instructing his son in the wisdom of right and wrong (Hamilton,  God's  Glory  in  Salvation,  290).  This  is  exactly  what  Solomon  asked  the Lord for in 1 Kings 3:9-the ability to \"discern between good and evil.\" What was  denied  to  humanity  in  the  garden  is  now  given  to  humanity  through  the wisdom of Proverbs-the fear of the Lord! Wisdom Is Discernment (1:4) Proverbs  1:4  says  that  wisdom  is  shrewdness  and  discretion.  Wisdom  is  the ability  to  read  a  situation  and  make  the  right  decision.  That's  the  point  of  the book.  Solomon  wants  to  give  this  discernment  to  the  inexperienced  and  the youth.  As  we  will  see,  Proverbs  gives  categories  of  people  (inexperienced, mocking,  foolish,  wise,  etc.).  Inexperienced  people  are  not  wise  or  foolish  yet; instead,  they  are  open  to  instruction  in  wisdom  or  folly.  They  are  gullible  and usually believe the most recent thing they have heard. They are easily enticed or persuaded (see the discussion in Longman, Proverbs, 96-97). This is the audience that  Solomon  is  going  after  because  there  is  still  hope.  Inexperience  and youthfulness often go hand in hand, and that is why Solomon is so concerned (as is  Moses  in  Deut  6)  with  parents  teaching  their  children  right  and  wrong. Proverbs tells those of us who are parents (and grandparents) that it is our task to instruct  our  children  in  wisdom.  Those  who  are  young  and  those  who  are inexperienced need to acquire the ability to perceive what's going on, make the right decisions, and avoid the bad ones. Wisdom Is Obtaining Guidance (1:5-6) Solomon says  that  a  wise  man  will  listen and  increase  in  learning;  a  wise man will  acquire  direction  and  guidance.  This  is  interesting.  The  audience  that Solomon refers to in this verse is \"a wise person.\" He says that the wise need to grow in learning and get direction. Huh? Doesn't being wise mean that you've arrived at the place where you don't need to learn anymore? Solomon says that's a foolish outlook on life. The truly wise will have the humility to know that they still need to listen to counsel instead of having the arrogance to think they have "}
{"Page": 10, "Info": "arrived.  The  wise  recognize  that  no  one  graduates.  We  all  need  to  hear  the wisdom of Proverbs again and again throughout our lives. Wisdom is not a goal to attain; it's a pursuit that you spend your whole life on. Solomon  says  the  point  of  the  book  is  to  help  you  understand  these  wise sayings so you can be wise and make wise decisions in your daily life. He's laid out  in  this  preamble  the  multifaceted  nature  of  wisdom.  Wisdom  is  being corrected and disciplined. Wisdom understands and reads situations. Wisdom is godly  morality.  Wisdom  is  justice.  Wisdom  is  discretion  and  discernment  of right  and  wrong,  stupid  and  smart,  what  path  to  take  and  which  one  to  avoid. Wisdom  is  listening  to  instruction  and  receiving  guidance.  But  now  that  we know what wisdom is, the question remains, \"How can we get it?\" How Do You Get Wisdom? (WHAT IS THE KEY TO BEING WISE LIKE THIS?) You Get Wisdom by Reverent Trust in the Lord (1:7) How  can  we  be  wise  like  this?  How  can  we  learn  to  read  situations  and  make wise  decisions?  How  do  you  get  this  multifaceted  wisdom?  As  we  will  see throughout the book, Solomon says that all wisdom is \"religious\" or spiritual in nature  because  it's  only  through  a  relationship  with  the  Lord  that  one  can  be wise.  The  fear  of-the  reverence  for-Yahweh  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and discipline, but the wise person is the one who fears, trusts, and reverences Yahweh. This is the first step and the essential component in gaining wisdom-the fear of the Lord. Proverbs is quite clear that the way to get  wisdom  is  to  depend  on  God  rather  than  on  yourself  (cf.  3:5-6).  The everyday, nitty-gritty details of your life are to be lived in fear of God. There is no  sacred  and  secular  divide  in  your  life.  We  so  often  think  that  \"going  to church\" and mission efforts and quiet times are the godly things we do in life. Other things like our work, our kids' soccer teams, or how we spend our money are the secular or neutral parts of our lives. Solomon crushes that. The everyday decisions  that  we  make  are  to  be  done  in  fear  of  the  Lord,  and  the  everyday decisions  we  make  reveal  whether  or  not  we  fear  the  Lord.  God  is  concerned with your whole life. The everyday decisions we make are indicators of whether we fear him or not. How you eat dinner, how you finish tasks assigned to you, how you spend money, how you parent your kids, and how you respond to your parents  are  all  before  the  Lord.  Every  nook  and  cranny  of  your  life  is  to  be governed by God. We all view the world in a certain way-through a certain lens. However, the "}
{"Page": 11, "Info": "fall of humankind into sin has assured that we do not see the world rightly. As an analogy, I ( Jon) am colorblind. I can't tell the difference between red and green and a whole host of other colors. I don't see the world the way it actually is. As a result,  I  make  poor  decisions  with  regard  to  fashion.  In  a  very  real  way,  that's what is true of all of us in our sin. We don't view the world the way it really is, so we make wrong decisions that go against the grain of how the world really is. However,  if  we  will  observe  the  world  through  the  lens  that  God  has  given  in fear  of  him,  we  can  start  perceiving  how  things  really  are.  And  once  we  start living according to that pattern, we will walk in wisdom. The only way to be wise is to trust in the Lord and be in a relationship with him.  Wisdom  comes  from  Yahweh  (2:6),  so  we  are  taught  in  the  Bible  to  ask him  for  it  (e.g.,  Jas  1).  According  to  Proverbs,  this  wisdom  is  filtered  through receiving  instruction  from  a  human  mediator  like  a  sage  or  a  parent.  In  our context that might mean a parent, a godly and wise friend, a Bible teacher, or a pastor. Fools are  arrogant  and  refuse correction  (Prov 1:7).  They are  worse than  the inexperienced because they aren't open to changing their minds. This means that really, really smart people can actually be fools. The question we all need to ask ourselves is, what category am I in? Am I one who is open to the instruction of the Lord? Am I one who is humble enough to seek counsel? Or am I a know-it- all?  Am  I  a  person  who  always  thinks  I'm  right?  Foolishness  is  doing  what  is right in your own eyes instead of what God has revealed. Disney says to \"follow your  heart,\"  but  the  Bible  says  those  who  are  left  to  themselves  and  to  their hearts will choose the wrong path. Following our heart is foolishness because we are broken people. Doing what is right in our own eyes is a recipe for disaster. Just read the book of Judges. There was no king in Israel, everyone did what was right in his own eyes, and the result was chaos (see esp. Judg 17-21). We need a loving  and  wise  King  who  can  rule  over  us.  Proverbs  reveals  that  Solomon  is training a Son of David to do just that, and in the fullness of time we see that his name  is  Jesus  of  Nazareth.  You  see,  Solomon  fails  to  live  out  the  wisdom  of Proverbs,  and  so  does  his  son  King  Rehoboam,  who  shows  his  foolishness  by listening to his peers rather than the elders of Israel (see 1 Kgs 12). But Isaiah 11 promises  that  the  Messiah  will  be  the  embodiment  of  the  book  of  Proverbs.  In fact, he is described with the words of Proverbs. Isaiah 11:2-3 states, The Spirit of the LORD will rest on him-a Spirit of wisdom and understanding, a Spirit of counsel and strength, a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD. His delight will be in the fear of the LORD. "}
{"Page": 12, "Info": "And when Jesus of Nazareth bursts onto the scene, he grows in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and people (Luke 2:52). He's called greater than Solomon (Matt 12) and the \"wisdom of God\" for us (1 Cor 1:24,30). \"In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge\" (Col 2:3). Getting  wisdom  is  important  because  it  will  help  you  make  decisions  in everyday life. It will help you \"win\" at life. But failing to get wisdom will wreck your  life.  The  problem  for  all  of  us  is  that  we  have  failed  repeatedly  because even  when  we  know  what  to  do,  we  often  don't  do  it.  This  reveals  our brokenness. Where do we turn? What's the answer for us? How can we become wise when we are so broken we can't even do what we know is right? What if wisdom wasn't a concept or an idea or a set of ideas you had to learn at  all?  What  if  Wisdom  was  a  person  you  could  know  and  have  a  relationship with? What if Wisdom was a person you could love and walk with, and just by knowing, loving, and walking with this person it would actually make you wise? 2 What if Wisdom was a person who spoke to you, and by listening to Wisdom's voice you could actually grow in wisdom?

Many families have been ruined by pursuing the Joneses. We've wanted money and stuff at any cost, and we've paid dearly for it. The  problem  for  so  many  of  us  is  that  we  think  this  is  only  a  problem  for people  on  Madison  Avenue.  This  is  a  problem  that  really  rich  people  have  to worry about. We can't see our own greed. We think our pursuit of nice things is normal and healthy. And yet, many families have been destroyed by the desire to accumulate nice things. Pastors never have someone schedule a counseling visit to  confess,  \"My  greedy  lust  for  money  and  things  is  destroying  me  and  my family.\" These families eventually feel the weight of the decisions they've made, but most of the time it is too late. We are too foolish to see our own greed, and we're too foolish to see the trap we are setting for ourselves right now. Solomon writes Proverbs 1:8-19 to warn his son that greed will destroy him, and the Spirit calls us to hear the warning as well. Getting Money the Wrong Way Will Destroy You "}
{"Page": 15, "Info": "Getting Money the Wrong Way Will Destroy You PROVERBS 1:8-19 King  Solomon-the  father-instructs  the  crown  prince-his  son-to  avoid greedy  gain.  He  pleads  with  his  son,  \"Listen  to  me!\"  Not  only  should  the  son listen to his father's instruction, he should also listen to the \"teaching\" (Hebrew word torah, often translated \"law\") of his mother. So both parents are responsible to  teach  their  children  the  law  (the  knowledge  of  good  and  evil).  Parents  are tasked with instructing their children in the way the world works (i.e., wisdom). Parents,  do  not  abdicate  this  responsibility  or  farm  it  out  to  teachers,  coaches, day care workers, or Bible study teachers. This is your job! Teach your children the  Word  of  God.  Teach  them  how  life  works  best  because  you  know  from God's Word what is best for them. Not  only  does  Solomon  plead  with  his  son  to  listen  to  his  parents  (v.  8);  he also tells him why to do so. He says, \"for they will be a garland of favor on your head  and  pendants  around  your  neck\"  (v.  9).  Since  jewelry  is  a  sign  of  health, prosperity, and honor, Solomon is saying that heeding his instructions will give the son a good life (Garrett, Proverbs, 69). After  making  this  exhortation,  the  father  turns  to  the  specific  life  lesson  he wants  his  son  to  learn.  He  gives  him  a  parable-a  story.  The  story  is  about resisting  the  temptation  to  join  a  gang  (a  peer  group),  kill  someone,  and  take their money. This calls to mind the story of the Good Samaritan where robbers beat the man and take his stuff (Luke 10:25-37). The father pleads with his son not  to  be  enticed  by  this  gang.  Don't  be  pressured  by  your  sinful  peers.  The reason  he  is  so  concerned  is  that  he  knows  where  that  leads.  He  makes  a common-sense observation about the outcome of such a decision: the outcome is death. So he appeals to his son not to walk in this way (Prov 1:15). Proverbs repeatedly presents the idea of two paths. There is a wise, righteous path that leads to life; and there is a foolish, wicked path that leads to death. So there is a double meaning in Proverbs 1:15. Solomon says, \"Don't go their way\" (i.e., don't follow them); and he is implicitly saying, \"Don't follow this course of life\" (i.e., the foolish path that leads to destruction). Solomon explains the outcome because he is a good teacher. A good teacher doesn't  just  tell  his  students  what  to  do;  he  tells  them  why  they  should  do  it. Don't follow this gang because \"they hurry to shed blood\" (v. 16); and it's not just  the  blood  of  the  innocent  that  they  shed,  they  also  shed  their  own  blood! Their devices turn back on them (v. 18). Solomon uses the illustration of a trap set in plain view so that a bird can see it. Even a dumb bird recognizes a trap if "}
{"Page": 16, "Info": "it's  not  camouflaged;  so  the  youth  should  have  the  sense  to  avoid  an  obvious trap, especially if a stupid animal has that much sense. The father is calling the robbers  dumber  than  birds.  They  don't  have  enough  sense  to  see  the  trap  and avoid it. No, they step into it. So, son, don't be foolish. Recognize that this will end  badly.  Solomon  concludes,  \"Such  are  the  paths  of  all  who  make  profit dishonestly; it takes the lives of those who receive it\" (v. 19). Being greedy to get stuff at any cost will wreck your life. Don't do it! The wisdom principle is clear: Getting money or stuff the wrong way (i.e., at others'  expense)  will  destroy  you.  Using  people,  abusing  people,  or  cheating people to get money will end badly. Unchecked greed, lustful desire, or ravenous craving for money and stuff at any cost will destroy you. It does not deliver what it promises. The Problem: It Doesn't Always Work Out Immediately, but It Will Work Out Ultimately! PROVERBS 1:19 This  story  and  lesson  raises  a  problem  for  many  of  us,  and  the  problem  is  a question: Is this true?4 Maybe someone robbed you and never got caught. We all know  the  stories  of  people  who  cheated  and  got  away  with  it.  We  all  suspect there  are  business  people  who  have  enriched  themselves  through  unethical practices. We know stories of those who used and abused others to get money, and they never got what was coming to them. Perhaps you've gotten away with something.  Maybe  you've  cheated  on  your  income  taxes  or  taken  money  from your  parents'  dresser.  And,  on  the  flip  side,  we  know  the  stories  of  those  who said no to bribes, refused to cheat, did things the right way, kept their integrity, and suffered loss for it. They didn't get rich. They missed out on the big bucks they could have had. I knew a missionary couple in Central Asia who ran a business selling school items as their platform to share the gospel. When I met the missionary, he told me,  \"We  are  the  only  business  in  this  marketplace  that  goes  through  the  right channels to get our business permits. Everyone else here bribes to operate their business, but we follow the law. We want to be honest citizens.\" I went back to that city a year later, and those missionaries had been kicked out of the country for not having a business permit. The government refused to renew theirs. This couple did things the right way, and they lost big time in return. "}
{"Page": 17, "Info": "Some cheat and never face the consequences in this life, and others are honest and  lose  everything.  So  how  are  we  to  understand  this  passage  now?  Is  this proverb true? Is its warning a promise? Some scholars solve this tension-their observation of cases to the contrary-by saying that the proverbs are just rules that are generally true but not always true. So they say these are not promises, just how things work out most times. That's not the whole story. The proverbs are promises. The proverbs will always come true. You can bank on them. We need to understand this about the proverbs. Proverbs are promises that generally come  true  now  but  always  come  true  later.  They  are  generally  true  in  this  life, but they are absolutely true in the life to come. Eventually these will come true even if they don't come true immediately.5 Again, wisdom is an order by which God made the world and behind which he stands to make sure that it happens. We see this in God's Word. Achan's greed was found out pretty quickly, and it cost him and his family their lives ( Josh 7). Ahab and Jezebel's greedy murder of Naboth to take possession of his vineyard didn't cost them their lives for years after their sin, but it did cost them their lives eventually (1 Kgs 22; 2 Kgs 9). So naked greed will destroy you-sometimes now and sometimes later. Your unethical  business  practice  may  be  exposed  shortly  and  send  you  to  jail.  You may steal petty cash and get fired or cheat on your taxes and get audited. Your greed may run your family into the ground, and you not see the toll it takes on your wife and kids for years to come; but eventually you will see it. But even if none of those things is uncovered in this life, they will be at the judgment. Any discomfort  you  feel  right  now  for  your  greed  is  only  a  tiny  foretaste  of  the ultimate  judgment  to  come  in  hell  (see  Rev  20:11-15,  the  Great  White  Throne Judgment). Our Biggest Problem Is That We Have All Failed at This (1:8-19) Our  biggest  problem  with  this  proverb  is  not  whether  or  not  it's  true immediately. Our biggest problem is that we've all failed to live out the warning given by Solomon. We have all walked in this foolish course of life and earned wrecking  our  lives  now  and  receiving  death  later.  The  problem  is  that  we  can easily bypass this text and ease our consciences with, \"I've never been tempted to  join  a  gang  to  kill  and  rob  someone,  so  I  guess  I'm  in  pretty  good  shape.\" That's probably true for most of us. We've never been tempted in that specific "}
{"Page": 18, "Info": "way, though perhaps some have. The problem is that you think that absolves you of any guilt, and you are wrong! You may have never joined a gang to kill and rob someone, but what about the force of the text? Have you ever given into peer pressure to do something you shouldn't? Have you ever done something wrong to be accepted by the crowd? Have you ever been so lonely and desired relationships so badly you found them in  the  wrong  place  and  in  the  wrong  way?  Have  you  ever  used  people  or manipulated  them  to  get  what  you  want?  Have  you  ever  swindled  someone? Have you ever lied or cheated to make a sale? Have you ever taken money from your parents or the government? Have you ever taken a friend to lunch and said, \"Ask me about my job, and I can pay for this with the company credit card\"? James, the brother of Jesus, tells us what leads to violence and murder. James says unmet cravings are the source for violence. James 4:1-2 says, What is the source of wars and fights among you? Don't they come from your passions that wage war within you? You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and wage war. The  reason  you  lash  out  at  people  is  because  you  don't  have  something  you want, including money and things. That's exactly what Solomon is talking about. Who among us has never craved this way? We can't ease our consciences with, \"I  haven't  acted  on  it.\"  James  says  you  are  a  murderer  in  training  if  you  are driven  by  unmet  desires.  You  already  have  the  motive-perhaps  someday  the opportunity will arise. This is in all of us, and we should be very afraid. We see this in our children. Not one of us has to teach our children to punch their brother, push their sister, or scream at the top of their lungs to get a toy they want. That's just part of our sinful nature. When we see something we want, we will do what we have to do to get it, including violence. The means of lashing out may change as we age, but the rage is still there. Some will be pressured into the  violence  of  abortion  simply  to  ensure  economic  stability  or  a  life  free  of stress.  Some  will  throw  trash  or  scream  hateful  things  at  refs  who  don't  give their  team  the  call.  Some  will  fight  at  a  funeral  over  the  exact  division  of  the inheritance. Who among us has not been green with envy of what someone else has  and  at  least  thought,  \"I  wish  I  had  that  life\"?  Have  you  ever  bad-mouthed someone  behind  his  back  because  he  got  the  promotion  instead  of  you?  Who among us has never used people to get something we want out of them? The problem is not money or things in and of themselves. \"Profit\" is a neutral term here (v. 19). It can be good or bad; it depends on how you get it (and how you use it). Proverbs is positive about wealth if a good work ethic is the means "}
{"Page": 19, "Info": "to  getting  it  and  generosity  is  the  way  you  use  it.  However,  sinful  means  of accumulating  wealth  are  wrong  (Longman,  Proverbs,  109).  Everywhere  in Proverbs it condemns and warns about easy money, get-rich-quick schemes (i.e., pyramid  schemes),  or  using  others  to  get  what  we  want.  Proverbs  15:27  says, \"The one who profits dishonestly troubles his household, but the one who hates bribes will live.\" This is true, yet we foolishly do it. Most of us justify our greed with  \"Well,  it's  my  money  not  the  government's,\"  or  \"My  company  doesn't need this as much as I do,\" or \"I know I'm a workaholic, but I am just trying to provide the best for my family.\" Solomon warns his son not to follow this path, but our problem is that we all fall into it. The \"American Dream\" is a nightmare according to the sage. It will destroy you. In high school I often used to sleep over at a friend's house, and we would sneak up to the pantry after midnight to get a snack. We loved to stay at his house because his dad was a very rich businessman, which meant they had a big house and awesome snacks. Many nights, while sneaking into the pantry, we would find his mom passed out on the rug in front of their TV. She would drink herself to sleep because her husband was so busy making money he rarely came home. He was never at his son's ball games. His drive to succeed absolutely tore his family apart. The sad part is he didn't see it coming because he thought all that  money  and  success  was  enough  to  make  them  happy,  and  instead  it  made them miserable. Solomon says that we will reap what we have sown. Our greed may cause us to lose a job, our reputation, or our family in this life; and it will certainly lead to judgment when we stand before God. Eventually it will be exposed. Eventually you will fall into the trap if you don't walk in the way of wisdom. First Timothy 6:9  says,  \"Those  who  want  to  be  rich  fall  into  temptation,  a  trap,  and  many foolish  and  harmful  desires,  which  plunge  people  into  ruin  and  destruction.\" We've  got  a  big  problem:  we  are  headed  for  a  trap,  and  we  can't  see  it  in ourselves  as  easily  as  we  see  it  in  others.  Of  course  this  isn't  a  good  path.  Of course  it  destroys  families.  We  can  look  at  the  miserable  lives  of  the  rich  and famous and see that. And yet we never see it in ourselves until it's too late! But there is good news . . . Jesus Can Save You from Your Foolishness PROVERBS 1:8-19 All  of  the  Bible  is  about  Jesus,  including  the  Proverbs.  Jesus  is  the  \"son\"  who grows in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man. Paul says that Jesus is "}
{"Page": 20, "Info": "the \"wisdom of God\" for us (1 Cor 1:24,30). Jesus is the one who can rescue us from our foolishness and make us wise. Amazingly, this proverb-this parable-plays out in the life of Jesus. Judas is enticed to join a gang who in turn sets a trap for an innocent man (cf. Prov 1:11). Judas does this to get money. The gang sets the trap, and they take the innocent man's life. Jesus is executed among thieves. Again, it looks like the proverb is not  true.  The  innocent  man  dies  the  death  that  thieves  deserve  to  die,  and  the guilty man lines his pockets. Judas threw in his lot with the gang to ambush an innocent man for profit, and it looked like he won; but by Sunday morning Judas is in the grave, and Jesus stands up and walks out of his! Jesus can rescue us from our foolish greed. Even though he was innocent, he was  hung  on  the  cross  between  robbers.  He  took  the  punishment  that  thieves deserve so that thieves like us could be forgiven. He took the punishment for our greed, for our cravings, for our violent hearts, so that we could be set free. He gives  his  Spirit  to  his  followers  to  empower  them  to  walk  in  his  wisdom.  He empowers us to avoid easy money, to be content, and to use our money to help others  instead  of  using  others  to  help  us  get  more  money.  He  gives  us  a  new community-the church-a community that does not entice us to sin but spurs us on to love and good deeds. "}

Yes, some do  cheat  to  get  money  and  never  face  the  consequences  in  this  life.  And  yes, some are honest and lose everything. What now? Wait on the Lord; he will turn the tables. Sometimes he does it in three days; sometimes he waits longer, but he will do it.

{"Page": 23, "Info": "Wisdom Is a Street Preacher PROVERBS 1:20-33 Main Idea: Wisdom is a person who pleads with us to repent and not perish. I. You Need to Accept Jesus, the Wisdom of God (1:20-23). II. Refusing to Accept Jesus Will Wreck Your Life (1:24-32). III. Accepting Jesus Leads to True Life (1:33). S everal  years  ago  I  (  Jon)  went  on  a  mission  trip  to  a  country  in  Southeast Asia. We would travel from place to place preaching the gospel, and then at lunchtime  we  would  stop  in  an  open  air  market  to  eat.  Our  trip  leader  was  a passionate evangelist, so after we had time to eat he would appoint someone to stand up on our jeep and use a megaphone to preach the gospel to the hundreds of  people  in  the  marketplace.  One  day  I  was  chosen  to  preach,  so  I  got  on  the jeep and as passionately as I could I gave the gospel. At the end of my sermon I invited anyone who wanted to respond to the gospel to come forward to talk with me. No one came, so I prepared to get down off the jeep. Our trip leader looked at me and motioned with his hand for me to continue to preach. So I preached for  a  few  more  minutes,  gave  the  invitation  and  no  one  came.  Our  leader motioned for me to keep going. This went on for several minutes. Finally, some teenage  boys  who  were  watching  me  began  to  laugh  at  me.  This  enraged  our group leader. He snatched the megaphone from me and walked toward the boys and shouted with a red face, \"You think this is funny! God is gonna laugh at you in  hell  one  day!\"  I  was  shocked,  and  so  were  the  teenagers.  It  was  quite  the scene. Hellfire and brimstone preaching can be harsh, and there are definitely wrong ways  to  do  it.  Many  people  can  use  the  threat  of  hell  as  a  way  to  manipulate people into making decisions. But many people preach with this kind of passion -like  our  group  leader-because  they  really  do  love  people  and  do  not  want them to perish. We can debate the most effective methods of evangelism and the best ways to go about it, but what we can't debate is that there is an urgent need to plead with those headed toward destruction to repent and believe the gospel. Shockingly,  in  Proverbs  1:20-33  Wisdom  is  presented  as  a  \"turn  or  burn\" street  preacher  who  appeals  to  \"the  inexperienced\"  to  turn  and  not  perish. "}
{"Page": 24, "Info": "Wisdom warns that we are heading for disaster because of our foolishness and brokenness. Wisdom pleads with us to repent. This passage is essential to rightly understanding  the  book  of  Proverbs  and  the  biblical  concept  of  wisdom. Ultimately, wisdom is not a set of ideas; wisdom is a person-Jesus Christ. You need to begin a personal relationship with him by faith. If you do, he will forgive your sin and give you his Spirit. This will lead you to wisdom for abundant life here  and  eternal  life  hereafter.  But  rejecting  Wisdom-Jesus-will  wreck  your life  here  and  condemn  you  eternally  hereafter.  Whether  or  not  you  have  a relationship with Jesus determines if you walk in wisdom or in a way that seems right to you. There are three inescapable realities that we see in Proverbs 1:20-33. You Need to Accept Jesus, the Wisdom of God PROVERBS 1:20-23 Too  often  we  think  of  Proverbs  as  an  Israelite  version  of  Dear  Abby.  We  think Solomon  is  simply  giving  us  wise  tips  on  how  to  live  a  successful  life.  The problem  is  that  we  are  broken;  so  even  if  we  know  the  right  things  to  do,  we often  choose  to  do  the  wrong  things.  We  say  things  before  we  think;  we  don't listen  to  advice;  we  tell  lies;  we  disrespect  our  parents;  we  brag  arrogantly  on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram; we waste time at work with Angry Birds; and we are stingy with our money. Proverbs has very good news for us. Wisdom is not primarily tips on how to live life; Wisdom is a person with whom you can be in a relationship-Jesus of Nazareth. When your vertical relationship with God is  right  through  Jesus  Christ,  your  horizontal  relationships  with  others  and  the world around you will be right as well. Proverbs teaches very clearly here that Wisdom is personal. You have to know Wisdom to walk the wise path in daily relationships, in the work place, or in how you use your words. Wisdom  cries  out  in  the  most  public  places  where  there  will  be  a  maximum number of people. She cries out in the streets, the open squares, the noisy places, and the city gates (Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 96). Solomon personifies his wise teaching as a woman-Woman or Lady Wisdom. He presents her as a preaching prophetess. This is a poetic device. Personification is representing an abstract idea as a person or creature.  This  mechanism  grabs  our  attention.  We  use  it  to  talk  about  the  flag (\"these  colors  don't  run\")  and  when  we  say  \"opportunity  knocked\"  or  \"Lady Justice is blind.\" This  may  raise  an  objection  in  your  mind:  \"Pastor,  you  said  that  Jesus  is Wisdom, but Solomon says Wisdom is a woman.\" Why does Solomon present a "}
{"Page": 25, "Info": "woman here? First, Solomon is symbolically talking about his wise teaching. He uses the poetic device of personification to get the reader's attention. Second, the Hebrew noun for wisdom is a feminine noun, so the personification will take on feminine  characteristics  (again  this  is  poetry;  it's  not  saying  that  Jesus  is  a woman). Hebrew, like Spanish and French, has gender identities for its nouns; so when there is a metaphor, it takes on that identity (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15, 83).  Third,  Solomon  knows  that  his  son-a  young  man-will  be  drawn  to  an attractive woman. In order to get his son to listen to his teaching, he personifies it as a beautiful woman whom he wants his son to marry. This might have helped me ( Jon) in high school. I hate biology. I almost failed the subject. It was boring to me, and I didn't understand it. But if my teacher had presented biology to me as Ashley-the beautiful, smart, funny, complex woman that I married and seek to learn about on a daily basis-then I would have been all ears! That's exactly what  Solomon  is  doing  here.  He  is  telling  his  son  that  learning  the  wisdom  of Proverbs  is  as  scintillating,  exhilarating,  enjoyable,  and  satisfying  as  pursuing and marrying a knockout woman! Later, in Proverbs 8-9, Solomon will reveal that Woman Wisdom doesn't just stand  for  Solomon's  wisdom;  she  also  stands  for  God's  Wisdom  that  is  being revealed through Solomon in Proverbs. In the fullness of time, God reveals to us what  Solomon  couldn't  have  fully  known:  that  Jesus  is  God's  Wisdom  in  the flesh. First Corinthians 1:24 and 30 state, Yet to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. . . . It is from him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom from God for us-our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. Christ  is  the  embodiment  and  fulfillment  of  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs  in  the same way that he is the embodiment of the Word itself ( John 1). So ultimately, the  only  way  to  become  wise  is  to  accept  Jesus's  invitation  into  a  personal relationship by faith. That invitation is presented here with Woman Wisdom being a \"turn or burn\" street preacher who gives an urgent invitation to the inexperienced: If they listen to her voice and begin a relationship with her, they will be wise and live; but if they refuse, they will be foolish and die. Like a good street evangelist, she goes to  where  the  people  are-the  crowded  places.  She  urgently  warns  them  to respond instead of heading on a destructive path. She pleads with three classes of people  who  have  not  yet  made  a  decision  one  way  or  the  other  about  wisdom (about  Jesus!):  (1)  the  inexperienced  (i.e.,  gullible),  (2)  the  mocker  (i.e.,  the "}
{"Page": 26, "Info": "hard-hearted),  and  (3)  the  fool  (the  middle  of  the  three  classes)  (Longman, Proverbs, 112). She calls them to repent upon hearing her sermon. In the fullness of time Jesus calls  us  to  repent  when  we  hear  the  gospel-to  receive  him  and  his  word. Repentance  is  the  key  response  to  Jesus's  message.  You  must  recognize  that you're  on  the  wrong  path  because  of  the  foolish  choices  you've  made  and continue to make, then you must choose to follow Jesus. Jesus does very much the same as Woman Wisdom. In the Gospels he goes to people  and  calls  them  to  follow  him.  You  have  a  choice  between  two  paths (wisdom  or  foolishness),  which  is  ultimately  a  choice  between  two  persons  ( Jesus  or  Satan).  Turn  around  and  run  toward  Jesus-that's  conversion.  That's salvation. That's wisdom! If you do repent, Wisdom promises two things to you. First, you will receive Jesus's Spirit. Turning to Wisdom will lead to receiving the spirit of wisdom (v. 23). There is much going on here. The Spirit of God hovered over the waters at creation to make the world. The Spirit and wisdom were given to temple builders in  the  Old  Testament  like  Solomon  (see  Exod  31:1-2  and  the  building  of  the tabernacle).  The  tabernacle  and  the  temple  were  patterned  after  the  garden  of Eden, so they were in a real sense a rebuilding of creation or a \"new creation.\" The Spirit of wisdom is also given to Messiah since he will ultimately make all things  new  (Isa  11).  Since  the  Spirit  built  creation  according  to  the  pattern  of wisdom and harmony, having the Spirit is essential to walking according to that pattern. The Spirit is given to you to transform you and to empower you to walk in  wisdom,  but  you  must  repent  to  receive  the  Spirit.  When  you  do,  the  Lord promises in Ezekiel 36:27, \"I will place my Spirit within you and cause you to follow my statutes.\" The  New  Testament  reveals  that  not  only  is  Jesus  the  Wisdom  of  God  who gives the Spirit, but he is also the Son of David who receives the Spirit; so the only way we can experience the Spirit of Wisdom is if we are found in Christ. Second,  if  you  repent  you  will  understand  Jesus's  Word.  Wisdom  will illuminate his teaching so you can understand it and walk in obedience to it. The Word  of  God  and  the  Spirit  of  God  go  together.  The  Spirit  is  the  one  who inspires  the  Word  to  be  written  (see  John  14-16;  Eph  6:17  \"the  sword  of  the Spirit\"). We see the connection of the Spirit and the Word clearly in Colossians 3 and Ephesians 5. Colossians 3:16 states, \"Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, . . . through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.\" Ephesians 5:18-19 says,  \"Be  filled  by  the  Spirit:  speaking  to  one  another  in  psalms,  hymns,  and "}
{"Page": 27, "Info": "spiritual  songs.\"  These  are  parallel  texts  that  link  the  \"Word  of  Christ\"  with being  \"filled  with  the  Spirit.\"  The  Spirit  who  inspired  the  Word  to  be  written will illuminate you to understand it through Jesus. So respond to the invitation of Jesus-the Wisdom of God-by repenting! Refusing to Accept Jesus Will Wreck Your Life PROVERBS 1:24-32 Wisdom  recounts  a  past  record  of  refusing  the  invitation  (i.e.,  the  teachings  of Wisdom). All of us have failed to live up to the standard of Wisdom. So Wisdom will  laugh  at  your  calamity  and  terror  and  distress  when  it  comes  like  a  storm (this language is reminiscent of the wisdom conclusion to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount).  Wisdom  here  is  clearly  linked  to  the  Lord  and  the  judgment  he  pours out.  The  Lord  is  the  one  who  ridicules  and  laughs  at  the  wicked  (Ps  2).  The judgment of the Lord is a storm (Ps 83:15). This passage reminds us of a modern parable:  hell  hath  no  fury  like  a  woman  scorned.  Those  who  scorn  Woman Wisdom will encounter fury. She  moves  from  accusation  to  sentencing.  She  says  that  trouble  will  come. Rejecting  Wisdom  will  lead  to  calamity  and  terror.  There  will  be  ruinous consequences  in  this  life.  Calamity  refers  to  things  that  will  wreck  your  life  or things  that  go  bad.  Terror  refers  to  the  things  you  fear  most.  Wisdom  says  that refusing her means your nightmares will come true. The things about which you lie awake at night, strategizing how you will avoid them, are the very things that will  happen  to  you  if  you  refuse  Wisdom.  Perhaps  that  hidden  sin  of pornography  will  be  exposed,  and  your  wife  will  be  devastated.  Perhaps  that affair with your coworker will be exposed, and your children will never forgive you. Perhaps your refusal to discipline your children while they are young will lead  to  them  wrecking  their  lives.  Your  refusal  of  Wisdom  will  catch  up  with you. And even if it doesn't catch up with you in the short run, it will catch up with you in the end. There may be some of you who think everything is OK because you're  able  to  hide  the  porn,  you're  able  to  hide  the  flirtatious  relationship  on Facebook,  and  you  think  you  will  always  be  able  to  manage  it.  You  think  it won't  ever  catch  up  to  you.  It  will!  There  will  be  a  final  judgment  where  all things are exposed and brought into the light. You will ultimately reap what you have sown, even if you don't in this life. You may walk in foolishness and even prosper in the short term, but eventually it will ruin you. Payday someday (as R. G. Lee famously preached) comes to all of us. "}
{"Page": 28, "Info": "Wisdom says that there is a final judgment, and it is certain. She says that at some point people will call for her and search for her, but it will be too late. She will have eye-for-an-eye retribution. They didn't listen to her, so she won't listen to them. They didn't seek her, so she won't reveal herself to them. Eventually it will be too late to repent. There's no second chance once final judgment is cast. If  you  continue  to  reject  the  kindnesses  of  Jesus-even  his  kindness  of  letting you ruin your life in foolishness right now-eventually it will be too late. Once final judgment is rendered, there's no turning back. Today  is  the  day  of  salvation.  That's  Wisdom's  purpose  in  this  sermon.  She wants to move the audience to present action. Wisdom doesn't want you to wait until you wreck your life. Jesus wants you to repent now and turn to him because he knows where you're heading, and he wants to save you from the ruin. This happened to them because they despised knowledge and didn't choose to fear Yahweh. They had their chance, and they refused. They rejected the wisdom of  this  book,  and  that  means  judgment.  Wisdom  tells  us  plainly  here  that rejecting  Wisdom  is  the  same  thing  as  rejecting  the  Lord.  All  of  the  practical wisdom  this  book  exhorts  you  to  do  and  all  of  the  foolishness  it  warns  you  to avoid is ultimately about whether or not you've accepted the Lord. The reason you are caught in that sexual sin, can't finish your homework on time, or shoot off at the mouth and get yourself in trouble is not just because you're an idiot. Ultimately  it  reveals  that  you  have  rejected  Jesus.  You're  not  in  right relationship  with  God,  so  you  are  not  walking  rightly  through  his  world.  This will ultimately mean judgment. Your failure is not a failure of effort or desire; it's  that  you've  missed  Jesus.  Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  mediator  who  brings  us into right relationship with God and the world around us. Choose humble faith in the Lord over your own way that seems right to you but leads to death. These  men  would  have  none  of  Woman  Wisdom's  ways,  so  they  face  the judgment. C. S. Lewis said there are two types of people in the world: \"Those who say to God \u2018Thy will be done,' and those to whom God finally says \u2018Thy will  be  done'\"  (Lewis,  Great  Divorce,  72-73).  Ultimately  God  will  give  us  what we've  chosen.  Proverbs  presents  judgment  as  reaping  what  you  have  sown.  If you  reject  Wisdom  (  Jesus),  you  will  eat  the  fruit  of  your  own  way.  The  Lord built  the  world  in  such  a  way  that  certain  consequences  are  inherent  in  certain actions.  Bad  actions  will  reap  bad  consequences;  good  actions  will  reap  good consequences. If you are lazy, you will be poor. If you cheat on your spouse, you will lose what you have. If you are hasty with your words, you will lose friends. This is the way the world works; and if you ignore that, you will wreck your life. "}
{"Page": 29, "Info": "God made everything, he knows how it works, and he reveals that to us because he loves us and wants what it best for us. The things he lays out in Proverbs are not  his  way  of  raining  on  our  parade  but  rather  his  way  of  telling  his  beloved children how life works best. We end up hurting ourselves, this text says, when we choose autonomy from God. It's not just that sin is wrong, although it is, but sin is also destructive. In the end, the Lord will see to it that his order works out. Proverbs  24:12  says,  \"Won't  he  repay  a  person  according  to  his  work?\"  So refusing the wisdom of this book (i.e., refusing Jesus), as we all have, will wreck your life now and/or later. The wages of foolishness is death. The judgment for unfaithfulness to the Lord is  death  (1:32).  The  \"apostasy\"  (abandoning  of  the  Lord)  of  the  inexperienced will kill them. This word apostasy is used in Jeremiah and Hosea for cheating on the  Lord  (  Jer  2:19;  Hos  14:4).  Foolishness  isn't  about  mental  capacity;  it's rebellion against God. The sentence for that is death. In the immediate context of Proverbs 1:32-33, this means the \"death\" of exile for Israel. And for us, in the scheme of the whole Bible, it means eternal banishment in hell. The really sad part of verse 32 is that it talks of the \"complacency\" of fools. We can be lulled into a false sense of security thinking that everything is fine. We can think that our folly is not that big a deal. \"This isn't something I need to worry about right now; I've got plenty of time to address that.\" We often don't recognize that our behavior, which we think may just be a minor character flaw, is a rebellion that will ultimately destroy us. Accepting Jesus Leads to True Life PROVERBS 1:33 While the complacent fool will have his feet knocked out from under him, those who accept Wisdom-those who listen to her and are in a personal relationship with her-will live securely and be unafraid of danger. Again, in the immediate context of the life of Israel, this refers to safe dwelling in the land without fear of enemies or exile. In the context of the whole Bible, this refers to living with God forever in the homeland he has provided for us, the new creation. We experience something of this confidence now because we know that our ultimate enemies- sin,  Satan,  and  death-can't  ultimately  destroy  us  when  we  are  in  Christ.  This knowledge should enable us to sleep at night without nightmares that our worst fears will be realized. "}

Wisdom-Jesus-Will Save You from Evil (2:12-22). W hen  I  (  Jon)  was  five  years  old,  my  parents  volunteered  to  clean  the church  building  once  a  month  on  Saturdays.  On  the  Saturdays  that  they cleaned,  they  brought  their  four  sons  with  them  and  told  us  to  play  on  the playground. There was a bridge on the church property that overlooked a creek. My dad sternly warned us not to go down to the bridge or play in the creek or we would get a spanking. We were to stay in the playground only. Well, we didn't listen to my dad. We went to the bridge to throw rocks into the creek. Once we had  thrown  all  of  the  rocks,  we  started  to  frantically  look  for  more  rocks  to throw. I saw one on the ledge on the other side of the bridge rails, so I decided I could  climb  over,  hold  onto  the  rail  so  I  wouldn't  fall,  and  grab  the  rock  to throw. My plan didn't work. I fell into the creek, almost breaking my ankles. My brothers helped me up to the building, where I entered the room my parents were cleaning, soaked to the bone. My dad made good on his threats! The reason my dad warned us not to go down to the bridge or the creek was because  he  wanted  what  was  best  for  us.  He  didn't  want  us  to  get  hurt.  At  the time I thought he was trying to keep me from having fun, but that wasn't true. He knew that the most fun we could have was on the playground. And he knew that  even  though  the  bridge  looked  fun  at  the  time,  there  was  danger  there.  I should have listened to his voice. In  life  we  are  bombarded  with  all  kinds  of  voices  and  messages.  These  are human voices. They might be a parent, a teacher, a coach, a coworker, a friend, or a commercial, but these human voices have spiritual voices and messages that stand  behind  them.  There  are  godly  messages,  and  there  are  evil  messages. These  messages  instruct  us,  exhort  us,  warn  us,  and  make  promises  to  us.  The questions  we  must  ask  are,  Whose  voice  will  I  listen  to?  What  message  will  I trust as good and helpful? What message will I reject as bad and harmful? "}
{"Page": 33, "Info": "God warns us and instructs us to keep us from harming ourselves-not to keep us from having fun. He wants what is best for us, and he doesn't want us to hurt ourselves. Will you listen to his voice? Or will you listen to the voice of another because it seems to offer more happiness at the time? The difference between the good life and the foolish life is the voice you heed. This is the key to Proverbs. Wisdom  is  a  person-Jesus.  Will  you  listen  to  him?  If  you  will,  he  will  make you wise. But we learn in Proverbs 2 that foolishness is also personal. There are voices in your ear, in your head, and the person Folly often stands behind them trying  to  get  you  to  yield.  Will  you?  Notice  the  competing  voices  in  Proverbs 2:1-22. Make a Decision for Wisdom-Jesus Christ PROVERBS 2:1-11 Proverbs 2:1-11 motivate the son to get wisdom, and verses 12-22 tell him the dangers that wisdom will deliver him from. Verses 1-4 give a conditional clause. If you do this, then this will happen as a result. Again, Solomon is a masterful teacher. We can't just tell our children what to do; we must tell them why they should  do  it.  Verses  1-4  pose  the  condition  for  the  son-if  he  will  pursue wisdom-then  verses  5-11  tell  him  the  helpful  outcomes  it  will  produce  in  his life, such as a right relationship with the Lord who grants the gift of wisdom and a new ability to walk in righteousness (as promised in the introduction; see 1:1- 7). Solomon appeals to \"my son\" (v. 1). The father-King Solomon-is teaching his son-the crown prince-wisdom. Again, Solomon is obeying the exhortation of  Deuteronomy  6  to  teach  the  law  to  his  children,  and  he  is  obeying Deuteronomy 17 that says the king is to be a man of the law in order to establish his  kingdom.  He  wants  his  son  to  receive  his  sayings  and  hide  his  commands within his heart. The son will only do this if he trusts that the wise sayings are true.  Solomon  wants  his  son  to  commit  to  and  embrace  his  teaching.  His teaching is the rest of the book. Proverbs 2 seems to imply that the wisdom of Proverbs is the law of Moses fleshed out in daily life. That's why the teachings are  repeatedly  called  \"laws\"  or  \"commandments.\"  That's  why  wisdom  starts with the \"fear of the LORD\" (i.e., love God, which is the greatest command) and leads to how you treat others (i.e., love neighbor, which is the second command; Matt 22:34-40). In order for the son to live them out, he must internalize them. The law needs to be written on the heart. But how? Words can go in one ear and "}
{"Page": 34, "Info": "out  the  other.  But  words  can  also  go  in  the  ear  and  down  into  the  heart  to produce inward-out transformation (Prov 2:2). Solomon exhorts his son to call out for understanding (i.e., call out to Wisdom like she called out to you; 1:20-33). If the son will call out to her, she will save him from evil (vv. 12-19). Solomon tells his son to seek wisdom like a hidden treasure.  Go  on  a  treasure  hunt  for  wisdom  because  wisdom  is  more  precious than silver or gold (8:10). Nothing you desire can compare with wisdom. If  the  son  will  commit  to  Solomon's  teaching-if  we  will  commit  to  Christ, the  embodiment  of  Solomon's  teaching-then  we  will  understand  the  fear  of Yahweh  and  know  God.  Wow!  Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  mediator  who  brings you into right relationship with God. There is a reciprocal cycle laid out here in Proverbs 2. Seek Wisdom, and you will  find  God.  Find  God,  and  you  will  gain  wisdom.  A  right  relationship  with God  will  make  you  wise.  Knowledge  implies  an  intimate  relationship.  This happens  by  faith.  Oftentimes  allegiance  precedes  understanding.  I  was counseling  with  an  unbeliever  whose  marriage  was  ending  because  of  his addiction to pornography. This man was a confessed atheist, yet he came to me for counseling. I tried to lay out, as best I could, the wisdom of God's design for sexuality.  But  I  constantly  told  the  young  man  that  this  won't  work-these things won't make sense to you-unless you first believe Jesus is Lord and his ways are best. And they didn't end up working for him. This is the cycle we see here. So we should pursue wisdom by studying Proverbs and calling out to Wisdom ( Jesus) because that will lead us to know God. This is essential because the Lord is the one who gives wisdom; it comes from his mouth (2:6). There is a paradox here.  Wisdom-like  salvation-is  both  a  gift  to  be  received  and  something  to work out with fear and trembling (Phil 2:12-13). Wisdom is a pursuit (Prov 2:1- 4) and a gift (vv. 6-7) (Goldsworthy, Tree of Life, 52-53). So we need to be diligent and work at wisdom. As Solomon does, we need to observe the world around us and see how it works. Solomon looks at ants and is instructed (6:6-8). We need to do this as well, but we do it through the fear of the Lord-through dependence on God and his Word. And as we seek, God grants more to us. James 1:5 says that  if  we  lack  wisdom  we  should  ask  the  Lord  for  it  because  he  gives  it generously. Solomon already knows this because he asked the Lord for it (1 Kgs 3).  The  gift  of  wisdom  is  found  in  God's  Word.  Solomon's  words  are  God's words, and we should commit to them because wisdom is found here. "}
{"Page": 35, "Info": "Proverbs 2:6-9 clearly states that the Lord gives wisdom as a gift to his faithful covenant  people,  and  he  thereby  guards  them  from  the  temptations  that  might destroy them (we will see this later). Commit to the Lord's wisdom, and you will understand  righteousness  and  the  good  path  (v.  9).  We  see  in  Proverbs  2  the same words used to describe multifaceted wisdom in 1:1-7. So pursuing wisdom and receiving it from the Lord will give you what the introduction to Proverbs promised. Again, wisdom is not a high IQ; it's moral discernment of good and evil.  It  is  the  ability  to  see  life  from  God's  perspective  and  then  to  act accordingly. How does God produce morality in us? Proverbs 2:10 says that wisdom will enter our hearts. For us to walk the path of righteousness and wisdom, we must have  the  law  written  on  our  hearts  and  experience  an  inner  transformation. That's  the  only  way  we  can  obey  God  (see  Jer  31;  Ezek  36).  Proverbs  is  not teaching  tips  for  behavior  modification.  That  won't  work.  You  can't  obey  the Lord  until  you  know  him  intimately  in  a  personal  relationship  and  his  law  is written  on  your  heart.  When  that  happens,  discretion  will  keep  a  protecting watch over you (v. 11). This is essential to wisdom in daily life. You must listen to  the  voice  of  the  Lord  (vertical  relationship)  in  order  to  live  wisely  before others  in  the  world  around  you  (horizontal  relationships).  He  will  protect  you. That raises the question, What do you need protection from? Wisdom-Jesus-Will Save You from Evil PROVERBS 2:12-22 Wisdom  will  save  you  from  the  path  of  evil  that  leads  to  death.  There  are  two groups mentioned in verses 12-22-two sets of voices that can pull you toward ruin and death: (1) evil men and (2) an evil woman. First, wisdom will save you from the men who speak perversely (v. 12). These people,  similar  to  the  gang  of  Proverbs  1:8-19,  are  rivals  to  the  voice  of  the father  and  the  voice  of  God.  And  as  we  will  see  later  in  Proverbs,  there's  a personal being that stands behind these human figures. Like Satan in the garden, these men distort reality and try to get you to follow the distortion. They seduce you. That's what it means to speak perversely. Perverse speech distorts ultimate reality. The people who are saying this may genuinely believe that what they are saying is right and true and helpful, but it goes against the created order. Their words  go  against  the  way  things  really  work.  For  example,  a  woman  may genuinely think that marriage is just about two people who really love each other instead  of  a  covenant  relationship  between  one  man  and  one  woman  for  a "}
{"Page": 36, "Info": "lifetime. But that goes against the natural and God-ordained order of things. A man  may  think  that  not  being  happy  with  his  wife  is  a  legitimate  ground  for divorce, but that goes against the order of things as established by God. A boy or young  man  may  genuinely  think  that  fooling  around  with  his  girlfriend  before marriage just helps you know what you like and don't like, but that goes against the order of things and God's call to be holy. Perverse  speech  calls  sin  \"good\"  and  rejoices  in  evil.  Proverbs  24:24  states, \"Whoever  says  to  the  guilty,  \u2018You  are  innocent'-peoples  will  curse  him,  and nations will denounce him.\" Justifying someone's sin or saying that it's not a sin is  perverse  speech.  For  example,  it  is  perverse  speech  to  tell  someone  their grudge is warranted because the hurt perpetrated against them was very severe. It  is  not  right  in  the  eyes  of  God.  Proverbs  30:20  says,  \"This  is  the  way  of  an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u2018I've done nothing wrong.'\" People can find all kinds of ways to justify their sin as if it's not wrong. \"It's OK for me to flirt with this woman at work because my wife doesn't respond to me the  way  that  she  should.\"  With  our  mouths  we  justify  and  rationalize  and minimize our sin or the sins of others. Any person who will counsel you in such a way as to justify sin in your life is someone of perverse speech that should be avoided. They are leading you down dark paths, and they rejoice in evil (2:13- 14). Wisdom will deliver you from them. What are the harmful consequences for listening to counsel like that from yourself or someone else? They will take you down the twisted path toward death. Wisdom will also save you from the \"forbidden [or foreign] woman\" who is smooth-tongued (v. 16). This is the first time we meet the forbidden woman in Proverbs;  she  will  be  a  major  character  in  this  book.  She  is  the  subject  of  the father's warning many times. She is clearly presented as Solomon's competitor for his son's affection and attention because her \"flattering talk\" (v. 16) rivals his words (v. 1) and the Lord's words (v. 6). Her flirtatious words mimic the dad in order to get the son to listen. Who will he listen to? Here she refers to a literal person with whom the son can commit sexual sin. But later she will be personified as Woman Folly-the rival to Woman Wisdom (Prov 9). Folly will be described in the same way as this woman. They are both flatterers who lure their prey to death (cf. 5:3; 7:14-21; 9:13-17 and 2:18; 7:27; 9:18)  (Murphy  and  Huwiler,  Proverbs,  21).  If  the  son  begins  an  affair  with  this forbidden woman, it will reveal that he has rejected his father, Wisdom, and the Lord.  Embracing  the  human  forbidden  woman  by  means  of  sexual  sin  reveals "}
{"Page": 37, "Info": "that spiritually he is in a relationship with Woman Folly instead of Wisdom (i.e., Jesus).  This  is  not  shocking  since  sexual  sin  and  spiritual  sin  are  tied  together throughout  the  Bible.  Already  in  Proverbs  1:32  rejecting  Wisdom  is  described with the same word as unfaithfulness to the Lord in the prophets. Adultery is the distortion of the most intimate human relationship, and 1 Corinthians 6 reveals that it is also a distortion of the most intimate spiritual relationship. The whole point of Proverbs 1-9 is that if our horizontal relationships are off, our vertical are  as  well,  and  vice  versa.  Solomon  knows  this  full  well  because  he  fell  for forbidden  \"foreign\"  women  who  led  him  to  idolatry  and  destroyed  his  dynasty (1  Kgs  11:1-5).  Falling  for  the  forbidden  woman  would  reveal  that  the  son  is being led away from the Lord (Wisdom) and is instead embracing Folly. How  does  this  woman  work?  She  flatters  with  her  words.  This  is  perhaps shocking to some. Most of us think of unfaithfulness as starting with looks, but that's not the case in Proverbs. Adultery and sexual sin start with flattery. One of the top needs that men have is respect and admiration; so if a woman inflates the male ego, he will usually respond. They are suckers for flattery. This may start in a subtle way that  the man doesn't recognize as unwise. His coworker might lend  a  sympathetic  ear,  or  she  may  laugh  at  his  jokes.  He  may  think  of  their conversations  as  just  \"harmless  flirting.\"  Or  perhaps  he  justifies  his  flirtation with, \"I'm not happy at home.\" Before long, he starts to look forward to work events  that  she  will  be  at,  or  he  begins  to  send  secret  messages  to  her  on Facebook. Before he knows it he's cheating on his wife, and it all started with what  many  looking  on  would  justify  as  \"harmless  conversation.\"  This  can happen with women too. Solomon is teaching his son, but if he was teaching his daughter he could warn about forbidden men that flatter with their words to get women to do what they want! Any sexual activity outside marriage's covenant commitment before God and witnesses to your heterosexual spouse is sinful, foolish, and deadly. This woman forsakes her husband and the vows she made to her God, and she will lead you to do the same. She violates the covenant law of God, and so would you by your foolish  embrace  of  her.  Her  house  sinks  down  to  death,  and  those  who  enter never  return  to  life.  This  destruction  may  happen  now  with  the  loss  of  your family,  your  reputation,  or  your  money  in  alimony,  or  it  may  happen  later  at judgment.  But,  mark  it  down,  it  will  happen.  The  wages  of  sexual  sin  is  death with  no  hope  of  return.  What  is  the  antidote?  Proverbs  2  says  that  it's  a  right relationship  with  God  through  Wisdom  (vertical  relationship),  and  Proverbs  5 says it's an intimate relationship with your wife (horizontal relationship).

The  upright-those  who  are  connected  to  the Lord through Wisdom ( Jesus)-will inhabit the land (i.e., Israel in that context and the new creation for us in Christ). This is a reference to the eternal life with God in the homeland he provides for us. But the wicked-those following after Folly as evidenced by their distorted worldview and sexual sin-will experience the  \"death\"  of  exile  (i.e.,  Israel's  exile  in  that  context,  and  ultimately  hell  for those outside of Christ). Conclusion Jesus is not only the Wisdom of Proverbs, but he is also the Son who perfectly listens  to  his  Father,  perfectly  keeps  the  covenant,  and  avoids  immorality. However,  in  the  end,  Jesus  takes  the  penalty  that  covenant-breakers  like  us deserve. He went down into death for sexual sinners like us, but three days later he  triumphantly  returned  to  the  paths  of  life!  Through  his  life,  death,  and resurrection he has defeated all of our enemies. It is not inevitable that they will drag  you  down  to  death.  He  can  rescue  you  from  them  by  empowering  you  to walk  in  wisdom.  It  is  not  inevitable  that  they  will  cause  your  exile  from  God forever.

But  once  I  graduated  and  ceased  to  play  competitive sports, I no longer had any motivation to work out and stay in shape. The results were not good! Solomon understands our need for motivation. He wants his son to  be  wise,  but  he  knows  that  he  needs  to  motivate  him  in  order  to  get  him  to train in wisdom. Proverbs  3:1-12  is  about  being  in  a  faithful  covenant  relationship  with  God. Israel  was  in  a  covenant,  marriage-like  relationship  with  the  Lord  that  was established at Sinai during the exodus. This covenant involved commitments that were  to  be  upheld  by  each  partner.  We  see  this  laid  out  here.  In  our  modern translations, the odd-numbered verses give the obligations of the human partner in the covenant, and the even-numbered verses give the obligations of the divine partner.6 We Should Keep the Covenant PROVERBS 3:1,3,5,7,9 The odd verses give the obligations that we are called to live up to if we are in a covenant relationship with the Lord. Solomon starts in verse 1 by saying, \"My son,  don't  forget  my  teaching,  but  let  your  heart  keep  my  commands.\"  Again, the father is King Solomon, and the son is the crown prince. He exhorts his son to obey the law-his teaching (Hb torah) and commands. We've seen throughout the  Proverbs  that  there  is  a  strong  connection  between  the  law  and  wisdom. Deuteronomy  4:6  says  that  keeping  the  laws  is  the  wisdom  of  Israel. Deuteronomy  6  commands  parents  to  teach  the  law  to  their  children,  and "}
{"Page": 41, "Info": "Deuteronomy 17 commands the king to be a man of the law. Solomon is obeying all of this in Proverbs by showing how wisdom is obeying the law in daily life. He is training his son in this so that he can establish the messianic kingdom. But the law must be internalized in order to be obeyed. There has to be inward transformation  where  the  law  is  written  on  the  heart  (  Jer  31;  Ezek  36). Theologians  call  this  \"regeneration.\"  We  see  this  not  only  in  verse  1  with  \"let your heart keep,\" but we also see it in verse 3: these teachings must be written on  the  \"tablet  of  your  heart.\"  This  is  covenant  language.  \"Loyalty  and faithfulness\" are words that are associated with the covenant and the royal rule of the king (Prov 20:28). The covenant must be written on the heart of the king and  the  people  for  the  kingdom  to  flourish.  Solomon  says  to  \"tie  them  around your neck\" (v. 3), which recalls the language of Deuteronomy 6 where the law was  to  be  bound  on  the  hand  and  inscribed  on  a  frontlet  for  the  eyes.  And  the command to write it on the \"tablet\" of your heart connects much Old Testament expectation.  The  Ten  Commandments  were  written  on  stone  tablets,  and  the people didn't obey them (Exod 20; Deut 5). But Scripture promises that a day is coming when the covenant will be written on the tablet of the heart so that one can obey. The Lord will perform this. In Jeremiah 31:33 the Lord says, \"Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days\"-the Lord's declaration. \"I will put my teaching within them and write it on their hearts.\" So,  as  anticipated  by  the  rest  of  the  Old  Testament,  Proverbs  recognizes  the need  for  inward-out  transformation,  not  behavior  modification.  Proverbs  isn't exhorting  us  to  behavior  first  and  foremost;  it's  advocating  our  need  for regeneration before these things can be followed. How does this happen? Verses 5 and 7 say you should trust the Lord instead of trusting  yourself.  One  could  boil  the  whole  of  Proverbs  down  to  this  truth. Obedience to the law starts with faith. This is the key to wisdom, as 1:7 already stated.  Trust  in  Yahweh  with  all  your  heart  and  don't  lean  on  your  own understanding. Trust God, not yourself. Foolishness is trusting in your own mind and  heart  (28:26).  Wisdom  starts  with  recognizing  that  you  don't  have  it  and looking  to  God  in  humility  for  it.  The  way  that  seems  right  to  humans  ends  in death.  We  think  that  what  is  best  for  us  is  autonomy  and  the  power  to  choose what  to  do  with  our  own  lives,  but  Proverbs  says  that  is  suicidal.  What  seems right to us usually ends up wrecking us. There is the wisdom of God, and there is the wisdom of humans. The world says that it's wise to live together before marriage, but God says that you can't practice  true  intimacy  without  a  covenant  commitment  where  you're  actually "}
{"Page": 42, "Info": "connected to each other. The world says it's wise to hoard your possessions, but Proverbs  11:24  says,  \"One  person  gives  freely,  yet  gains  more;  another withholds  what  is  right,  only  to  become  poor.\"  The  world  says  that  it's  OK  to hold a grudge-after all, how will the person know that what they did hurt you so  badly  if  you  let  it  go?  But  the  Bible  says  forgive  your  enemies.  The  world says it's wise to promote yourself, but that's not true in God's economy (27:2). Here's the key: don't be wise in your own eyes. That's the root of foolishness going all the way back to the garden of Eden. Instead, you should fear Yahweh. Thinking  that  you  are  wise  is  foolishness.  Wisdom  and  folly  boil  down  to humility  and  pride.  Submit  every  area  of  your  life  to  the  Lord,  and  he  will produce  wisdom  in  you.  If  you  do  veer  off  the  right  path,  Proverbs  3:7  says repent-turn away from evil. Recognize your sin and foolishness and turn from it to God. Solomon  gives  one  practical  example  of  how  inward  piety  leads  to  outward obedience  to  the  law.  Verse  9  speaks  of  generosity:  honor  the  Lord  with  your possessions  and  your  first  produce  (cf.  Lev  23:10;  Deut  18:1-5).  Again,  this  is covenantal  language  (i.e.,  obedience  to  the  law).  Give  back  to  Yahweh  out  of what he has provided for you. Give the firstfruits; give your best and your first to God,  not  the  leftovers.  This  means  giving  should  be  set  out  at  the  top  of  your budget,  not  at  the  bottom  \"after  everything  else  is  covered.\"  This  practice demonstrates  gratitude  for  what  God  has  given  and  confidence  that  he  will continue to provide (see 2 Cor 8-9). God Blesses Covenant-Keepers PROVERBS 3:2,4,6,8,10 The  even  verses  give  the  divine  partner's  obligations.  He  will  be  the  faithful rewarder. Verse 2 starts with the word for, which gives the why, the motivation. Following this law will add days, years, and peace to your life. Just like the fifth commandment,  Solomon  says  to  obey  your  dad,  and  in  return  you  will  live  a longer  life  and  a  better  life  (cf.  Eph  6:1-3).  In  Proverbs,  Solomon  does  give guidelines  for  healthy  living  that  will  generally  increase  your  chances  of  a  full life. If you unwisely get into drugs, illicit sexual sin, greediness for gain, or any number of follies outlined in the book, it can cut your life short. Ultimately, what is being taught here is eternal life and abundant life. This is picturing  a  return  to  Eden,  to  shalom,  to  the  way  things  are  supposed  to  be. There will be complete harmony with God, other people, and the world around you. That's what all the even verses are picturing. "}
{"Page": 43, "Info": "Proverbs 3:4 gives the reward for covenant loyalty, and that is acceptance and a good rapport with God and people. Again, wisdom is about right relationship with God and others. Verse 6 gives the promise of the Lord to make our paths straight. He will give divine direction and divine protection to our daily lives on the right path. Verse 8 gives the reward for fearing the Lord and not being wise in  our  own  eyes,  and  that  is  health.  A  well-ordered  life  leads  to  health  (by contrast, sexual sin can lead to disease according to Prov 5). The picture of all of these  verses  is  that  wisdom  reverses  the  curse  of  sin,  death,  and  sickness. Wisdom  is  a  return  to  paradise.  Leviticus  26:16  taught  that  breaking  the covenant would lead to disease. Proverbs shows that faithfulness to the covenant will lead to the blessing of health. Finally,  Proverbs  3:10  gives  the  reward  for  generosity  to  the  Lord,  and  that reward  is  full  barns  and  vats  that  overflow  with  new  wine.  God  will  bestow wealth  on  those  who  are  generous.  Again,  this  is  covenant  language. Deuteronomy 7:12-15 says that covenant faithfulness will lead to God blessing the fruit of the ground and taking away disease. If Israel obeys God, things will go well. The rain will fall, and the crops will grow (Deut 11:14; 28:8; Mal 3:10). When  Israel  disobeys,  the  reverse  will  happen  (Deut  28:51).  So  it  seems  clear that obedience will lead to God giving us more. This shouldn't surprise us. Good stewards can be trusted with more. My  (  Jon's)  parents  paid  for  me  to  go  to  the  University  of  Kentucky  my freshman  year.  But  if  I  had  partied  every  night,  shown  up  late  to  classes,  and flunked the first semester, do you think they would have continued to pay for my college? No! But since I went to class, finished assignments on time, and made good grades, they were happy to continue to pay my tuition. A good steward will be trusted with more, and a bad steward will lose what he's been given. So obey God by doing the odd verses and in return you will get the rewards of the even verses. But this raises an important question: Is this really true? What about instances where things don't work this way? This Is Generally True Now and Will Always Prove True Later PROVERBS 3:11-12 Are these verses teaching a prosperity gospel? Are they teaching that we should trust  and  obey  the  Lord  and  in  return  he  will  give  us  health,  wealth,  and happiness? The answer is, \"Yes, of course!\" But there's a problem. This doesn't "}
{"Page": 44, "Info": "always work out immediately in a fallen world. Sometimes you can believe and obey, and things go bad for you. You get cancer instead of health. Despite your great generosity to the work of the Lord, you get laid off. Sometimes we suffer now and receive the rewards only in the next life. So it's not your best life now; it's your best life later and forever. The proverbs are generally true now, but they are always ultimately true.7 In the  new  creation  we  will  experience  every  spiritual  and  physical  blessing  that has  been  promised  to  us.  Proverbs  3:11-12  helps  us  understand  this  interplay. Solomon tells his son to accept Yahweh's discipline and not reject it. Don't get mad  at  Yahweh  when  he  allows  discipline  in  your  life  because  he  does  so  for your  good.  In  order  to  be  truly  wise,  one  must  have  correction  and  discipline. That  is  key  to  the  book  because  left  without  discipline  we  will  go  down  the wrong path to destruction. That's our sin nature. The Lord certainly disciplines his children by holding their sin accountable to rid it from their lives; but he also might allow suffering into his children's lives, not as a punishment for sin but rather to produce maturity in their lives. While a parent disciplines a child for breaking rules, discipline is also what we do to our bodies when we excercise. You put your body under hardship so you can get in better shape for later. We voluntarily let hard things into our lives to prep us for something  much  better  later.  For  example,  when  our  older  daughter,  Maddy, began learning to read, it frustrated her a great deal. She got very upset that she couldn't read right away. She wanted to quit and play with her toys. But as she labored  through  the  hardship  she  became  a  great  reader  and  began  to  enjoy reading. God often operates in this way. He will allow hardship in our lives to produce something in us. In Deuteronomy 8 he tells the children of Israel that he let  them  endure  lean  times  so  that  when  they  had  plenty  they  wouldn't  forget him. Why  does  he  do  this?  Because  he  loves  us  just  like  parents  who  discipline their child out of love. He loves you enough to allow hardship at times to prepare you for something greater later. He loves us and wants to make us like Jesus, so that means discipline (cf. Heb 12-he allows suffering to produce holiness). So yes, God will reward us, but he doesn't always give us what we want when we want  it.  Instead,  he  gives  us  exactly  what  we  need  when  we  need  it.  He  will conform you to the image of his covenant-keeping Son so that you are the kind of  person  who  can  rightly  experience  the  covenant  blessings.  Sometimes  you will  suffer  now  and  not  receive  an  immediate  reward  because  the  Lord  is molding you for a greater glory later. "}
{"Page": 45, "Info": "The  problem  with  smiley  prosperity  preachers  on  TV  is  that  they  assume godly  people  will  never  suffer  in  this  life.  That's  unbiblical  (see  2  Tim  3:12). Godliness  through  Jesus  Christ  is  no  guarantee  that  things  will  always  go  well for you in this life (see Job). After all, our righteous King suffered in this life. But even if things go badly for you now, they will go well for you ultimately in the next age and be far better than any good life here. Finally,  the  last  problem  with  the  prosperity  gospel  is  that  it  bypasses  Jesus. The question must be asked, Who keeps the covenant? Jesus Kept the Covenant for You The false gospel of the prosperity preachers misunderstands that none of us are faithful covenant-keeping sons. None of us have been perfectly obedient to the Lord.  None  of  us  have  perfectly  trusted  God  instead  of  ourselves.  None  of  us have  perfectly  turned  from  evil  or  been  completely  generous  as  we  should  be. This covenant relationship between the Father and the Son is not kept by God's firstborn son Israel, nor is it kept by David, Solomon, or Solomon's sons. Jesus is the Son who finally keeps it. Luke 2:52 shows that he is the Son of Solomon who grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and people (cf. Prov 3:4)  (Goldsworthy,  Tree  of  Life,  57-58).  He  is  the  King  with  the  covenant  on  his heart (3:3; cf. 20:28). So he is the one who gets the blessing, not us. The  good  news  is  that  he  represents  us  before  the  Father  in  this  covenant relationship. He lived up to our obligations for us, and then he took the curses of covenant breaking in our place. He experienced sickness, sorrows, enemies, and a  premature  death  for  us  (see  Isa  52:13-53:12).  He  offers  full  pardon  to  all covenant-breakers  who  believe  in  him.  His  righteous  record  of  keeping  the covenant is credited to the account of all who are united to him by faith, and as a result  they  will  experience  the  blessings  of  covenant  faithfulness  by  his  merits not their own! And if you are joined to him by faith, God will do the work by the power of the Spirit to conform you into the image of his covenant-keeping Son -sometimes through discipline. As sons of the Father in Christ Jesus, this is how we are to live-this is now how  we  can  live.  Your  Christianity  has  never  been  about  keeping  the  rules  in order for God to save you. Christianity is about how God saves you through his Son and then molds you into his image so you can live out the life God meant for  you  to  live.  As  we  live  out  this  covenant  by  the  power  of  Jesus's  Spirit- obeying  the  law,  trusting  in  the  Lord,  looking  away  from  ourselves,  and  being generous to those in need-we recognize that the rewards will work out now or "}

Wisdom Will Give You God's Blessing Instead of His Judgment (3:27- 35). W hen  my  (  Jon's)  girls  see  commercials  for  toys  or  dolls  or  new Lalaloopsies, they exclaim, \"I have to have that! Mom, can I get it? Dad, can  I  get  it?\"  At  Christmas  time  or  for  their  birthdays,  we  have  a  hard  time getting them to narrow in on a few items they want. We have to ask them things like,  \"If  you  could  only  get  one  thing,  which  would  you  want?\"  We  want  to determine what their heart is set on above all else. What about you? What one thing do you want most? What in life do you have to  have?  Often  commercials  can  awaken  us  to  our  desires.  Maybe  there  are things you just have to possess, foods you just have to consume, or relationships you just have to have. What's the superior treasure in your life that you wake up thinking about, go to sleep dreaming about, and spend your day planning to get? It may be money, stuff, sex, success, or any number of things. Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  treasure  that  is  superior  to  all  that  we  can  set  our hearts on. Solomon will tell us in Proverbs 3:13-35 to seek Wisdom first, above all  else.  When  Solomon  wrote  these  words  he  was  encouraging  his  son  to commit to study this book-Proverbs. But in the fullness of time, the Spirit has revealed to us that Wisdom is a person-Jesus Christ. We are to seek him-the pearl of great price-above all else, and all these other things will be provided for us (Matt 6:33). If we set our supreme desire on things-even good things-it will  prove  disappointing.  It  may  even  wreck  our  lives.  But  when  we  set  our supreme  desire  on  Jesus,  we  are  able  to  enjoy  these  other  things  as  gifts  that cause our hearts to praise Jesus for providing them. Wisdom Will Give You an Abundant and Eternal Life "}
{"Page": 50, "Info": "PROVERBS 3:13-18 Proverbs 3:13-18 is a poem or a hymn about the supreme value of wisdom. As we've seen, Solomon has personified his wisdom as a beautiful woman. He says to get her above anything else. Again, in the fullness of time (Gal 4:4), the New Testament revealed to us that this personification pointed to a real person-Jesus of  Nazareth-whom  we  can  know  and  pursue  and  treasure  above  all  else.  The benefits of wisdom are given here to motivate us to be with her at any cost. The idea is to get wisdom because it leads to a happy and blessed life. We see that this idea brackets the poem (\"happy\" in vv. 13 and 18). This is called an inclusio (Garrett,  Proverbs,  257).  Garrett  points  out  that  this  passage  is  a  hymn  and  is bracketed  by  \"blessing\"  at  the  beginning  and  end.  Solomon  gives  a  beatitude: Blessed or happy will be the one who gets Wisdom-Jesus. Wisdom's profits are better than silver, gold, or jewels. Wisdom is better than money  and  stuff.  Wisdom  is  better  because  it  cannot  be  lost  or  destroyed  (see Matt 6; moth and rust destroy money and stuff). Wisdom is better because, as we saw  in  verses  1-12,  it  shapes  you  into  the  kind  of  person  who  can  enjoy  these things in the proper context. To paraphrase Waltke, money can put food on the table  but  not  fellowship  around  it.  Money  can  buy  you  a  house,  but  it  cannot produce  a  home.  Money  can  give  a  woman  jewelry,  but  it  cannot  buy  her  real love  (Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  257).  Wisdom  is  better  than  that.  Wisdom  gives physical,  spiritual,  and  relational  blessings.  Proverbs  teaches  us  that  wisdom creates  happy  homes,  loving  marriages,  and  treasures  that  cannot  be  valued  by marketplace prices. Riches won't ultimately make you happy, but Solomon says that  wisdom  will.  The  main  reason  is  that  wisdom  is  ultimately  not  a  thing; Wisdom is a person you can have a personal relationship with-Jesus. So get Jesus at any cost because nothing you could ever desire compares with him. Wisdom is better than anything you can desire, so grab her and don't let her go. Jesus-like the kingdom of God, the pearl of great price, the treasure in the field  (Matt  13:44-46)-is  worth  selling  all  that  you  have  to  get  him.  Is  there something that you desire more than Jesus? What is supremely valuable to you? Even if you wouldn't say it out loud, in your mind do you think, \"Well, for me to be happy, of course I need Jesus, but I also need a happy marriage. I need Jesus plus ______.\" What is it that you have to have in addition to Jesus? I need Jesus plus a promotion. I need Jesus plus the right car. I need Jesus plus a house in the right  neighborhood.  I  need  Jesus  plus  romance.  I  need  Jesus  plus  financial security.  I  need  Jesus  plus  the  perfect  Christmas  card  photo  of  a  family. "}
{"Page": 51, "Info": "Whatever you put in that blank is what you treasure most, since you've given it the same status as Jesus. Solomon exhorts us through the Spirit that if our heart is set supremely on the stuff of this life as the means to happiness, then we may lose those things, and happiness will certainly elude us. But if you set your heart supremely on Jesus, then you will certainly get true happiness, and he may provide you other things to enjoy in their proper context. But true happiness can only be found if Jesus is our supreme treasure. Seek wisdom above all else, and these other things will be provided for you. Solomon knows this. In 1 Kings 3 the Lord told Solomon he would  grant  whatever  Solomon  asked  for.  Amazing!  If  you  could  ask  God  for one  thing,  what  would  it  be?  Solomon  could've  asked  for  riches,  long  life, victory over  his enemies, or the most glorious empire  any king has ever ruled; but instead he asked for wisdom above all else. So the Lord gave him supreme wisdom;  and  the  Lord  also  provided  long  life,  money,  and  victory  over  his enemies. So  Solomon  tells  us  in  Proverbs  3:16-17  that  getting  wisdom  above  all  else will add long life, riches, a good reputation, and a pleasant course of life. Wow! You get to live longer because the wise and pleasant paths you are walking help you avoid the pitfalls that lead to an early death, and you receive honor because those paths help you avoid things that will damage your reputation. Living a life of risky and foolish behavior as laid out in this book-whether it be sexual sin, violent behavior, or not being able to control your tongue-may lead to an early death or at least a ruined reputation. On the other hand, heeding the wisdom of this  book  will  lead  to  wealth  since  hard  work  instead  of  laziness,  spending wisely  rather  than  frivolously,  and  saving  for  down  times  will  ensure  that  you have  the  provision  you  need.  Again,  following  the  wisdom  of  this  book  will generally lead to these blessings right now, but they will always ultimately lead to  these  blessings.  Proverbs  are  promises  that  are  generally  true  now,  but  they are always ultimately true. Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  tree  of  life  (see  Gen  2).  The  tree  of  life  is  only mentioned in Genesis, Proverbs, and Revelation. Eating from this tree will give you  immortality  (Gen  3:22).  Wisdom  (  Jesus)  is  the  path  to  eternal  life.  This entire  poem  is  calling  us  back  to  paradise  at  creation.  Proverbs  3:13  said  that happy  is  a  \"man\"  who  finds  wisdom,  but  the  Hebrew  word  used  there  is \"Adam.\"  Solomon  reveals  that  what  was  lost  in  Eden  by  human  sin  and  what separated  humanity  from  Yahweh  is  now  available  again  through  Wisdom. Indeed, in the garden humankind reached for knowledge apart from God and his "}

So seek Wisdom-Jesus-first, and all these other blessings will be provided for you! Wisdom Will Give You a Perception of How the World Works PROVERBS 3:19-20 Yahweh  created  the  whole  world  by  wisdom,  so  there's  a  wise  order  to  the world. The mention of the earth and the heavens in verse 19 is what scholars call a  \"merism.\"  A  merism  is  where  the  whole  is  communicated  by  mentioning  its extremities  (Murphy,  Pocket  Dictionary,  107).  For  example,  earth  (the  ground)  and the heavens (the sky) are used to talk about the whole of creation. Or consider, \"as  far  as  the  east  is  from  the  west,  so  far  has  he  removed  our  transgressions from us\" (Ps 103:12). This communicates that as far as our sins could possibly be removed from us, they have been. Solomon says the Lord created the whole of the cosmos by means of wisdom. This is not surprising because wisdom is a skill used for building in the Old Testament (e.g., the tabernacle in Exod 31; the temple in 1 Kgs 7; and now creation itself, which was the original sanctuary of God). This  is  why  wisdom  is  so  valuable.  There  is  a  wise  order  to  the  world.  The world works in a certain way-according to the pattern of wisdom-so you can know the order and live by it if you possess wisdom. In a fallen world that has been broken by sin, this order generally works out now; but it will always work out  later.  Wisdom  gives  you  the  ability  to  perceive  God's  order  and  live  by  it. You  must  live  by  this  order.  Don't  try  to  live  against  the  grain  because  that  is ruinous. Microwaves were designed to work in a certain way. Certain materials are  not  supposed  to  go  into  them.  One  time  my  (  Jon's)  youngest  brother  was eating something from Taco Bell, and he had some sauce packets he had saved in  the  fridge.  He  wanted  to  warm  the  sauce  up,  so  he  put  the  packet  in  the microwave. What happened next? A light show  on par with the Fourth of July went off in our microwave! That's true with creation as well. If you live against the grain of how things work or how wisdom has ordered the world, it will go "}

Solomon  tells  us  in  Proverbs  6  that  we  can  observe  ants  and deduce  that  hard  work  will  lead  to  provision  and  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty. You can observe that a soft answer cools fury. Dishonesty in the justice system will  destroy  a  society.  That's  just  the  way  that  the  world  works,  and  trying  to live against its order is suicidal. This wise order is also Christ-centered. It points to him. God created the world through Jesus ( John 1; Col 1), and Jesus is the one who upholds the world right now by his Word (Heb 1). Also, all things are being united in Christ (Eph 1), so all  things  are  centered  on  him,  including  the  created  order.  For  example,  the seasons  point  to  Christ.  There's  a  reason  God  created  the  seasons  to  work  in such a way that flowers and plant life die in the winter and come back to life in the  spring.  That  reason  is  Jesus  of  Nazareth-to  point  to  his  death  and resurrection. Since the created order is centered on Christ, you must know him in order to perceive and live according to the order. The order is personal because he is the one who created and upholds the world. Wisdom Will Give You Peace of Mind PROVERBS 3:21-26 Solomon  appeals  to  his  son  to  not  let  wisdom  and  discretion  depart  from  his sight  because  they  are  life  (vv.  21-22).  Keep  the  wisdom  of  this  book  through Jesus, and it will keep you secure from the ruin of the wicked when that comes (v.  25).  Solomon's  point  is  that  wisdom  keeps  you  safe  from  sudden  trouble. That's why you should get wisdom above all else. You will walk safely during the  days  of  your  life,  and  you  will  sleep  peacefully  at  night.  This  is  an  appeal from a parent who desperately wants his child to be safe. Don't we all? He says you won't stumble if you keep walking on the wise path (again, this is generally true now but always ultimately true). Wisdom  will  give  you  a  good  night's  sleep  without  worry  (v.  24).  You  will sleep  well  because  you  haven't  done  the  foolish  things  that  cause  you  to  stay awake worrying. You won't be afraid that you'll get caught or be found out. You won't  have  to  lie  awake  thinking  to  yourself,  What  if  she  reads  that  e-mail? What if he runs into that person? Who else knows about this? How can I make sure this never gets out? Walking in wisdom and avoiding the foolishness of sin will keep your conscience clear and your mind free from worry. And if you get wisdom,  you  will  ultimately  be  safe  because  Yahweh  is  the  one  who  watches over  you  all  day  long  (v.  26).  God  Almighty  will  be  looking  out  for  you!  The "}
{"Page": 54, "Info": "fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom, and he will keep those who fear him safe. Wisdom Will Give You God's Blessing Instead of His Judgment PROVERBS 3:27-35 Solomon  moves  from  our  vertical  relationship  with  Yahweh  (v.  26)  to  our horizontal  relationships  with  others.  Wisdom  teaches  that  if  your  vertical relationship  with  the  Lord  is  right  your  other  relationships  will  be  right  in everyday  life.  One  practical  example  of  keeping  this  wisdom  as  Solomon  has exhorted  is  being  a  good  neighbor.  You  are  not  wise  or  in  a  right  relationship with the Lord if you're not a good neighbor. If you love God, you will love your neighbor. Solomon first mentions two sins of omission (failing to do good), and then he mentions  two  sins  of  commission  (doing  something  bad).  Solomon  says  to  not withhold good from those to whom it's due when it is in your power to do it (v. 27). This refers to giving something good to someone who deserves it or needs it when you have the means. This could be giving a fair wage or money to a person in need. This could be a meal, clothes, a tool your neighbor is lacking, or some other physical aid. The wise are attentive to the needs of their community. They are the neighbors everyone wants to have. There was a communal life in the Old Testament, where the people of Israel were called to care for each other's property. This is true in the body of Christ as well. First John 3:17-18 says, If anyone has this world's goods and sees a fellow believer in need but withholds compassion from him-how does God's love reside in him? Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth. Proverbs 3:28 fleshes this out. Don't delay in doing good if you have the means. Don't  put  it  off  because  you're  lazy,  and  then  forget.  Don't  put  it  off  because you  are  indifferent  or  selfish.  Don't  just  try  to  get  rid  of  the  person  with  an excuse like, \"I don't have any cash on me.\" Right then, go the extra mile to meet the need. Failing to do good to your neighbor when it is in your power is foolish and wicked. It is sin. Solomon moves from failing to do good to actively doing evil. Don't plan evil against your neighbor who lives trustingly beside you (v. 29). Don't accuse your neighbor without reason if they haven't wronged you (v. 30). This can refer to a false accusation for gain. You accuse them out of jealousy, or you do so in order "}

You may have to take a neighbor to court to stop some injustice against your family, but you don't do it out of spite or to get even with them. And Paul makes clear that within the body of Christ this is not appropriate at all (1 Cor 6). Finally, Solomon exhorts his son not to envy the violent person who seems to prosper  because  of  his  schemes.  There  are  times  when  it  looks  like  following Wisdom-following Jesus-doesn't work like we think it should, and following the ways of evil can lead to short-term success. I mentored a guy several years back  who  was  distraught  when  he  came  to  meet  me  for  breakfast.  I  asked  him what  was  wrong,  and  he  told  me  that  a  guy  he  worked  with  came  into  work cursing because he had accidentally gotten his girlfriend pregnant. This crushed my  friend  because  he  and  his  wife  had  begged  God  for  a  baby  and  it  wasn't happening for them, but this guy was sinning and got a baby that he didn't want! There are times in this fallen world when it may look like the path of sin is the path to getting what we want. Solomon acknowledges that some people do use their power to manipulate and abuse others to get what they want, and they get it. You might be tempted to jealousy and to adopting their ways when you see their success. Solomon pleads with his son not to envy these people because in the end the tables will turn. In the end, they lose. Judgment will fall. God opposes these people, so they will not prosper forever. And God is for you if you belong to his Son; and that means even if you don't prosper right now, you will later. Yes, there's an order to the world where things work  out  in  a  certain  way.  Yes,  in  a  fallen  world  it  doesn't  always  work  out immediately. But God stands behind the order upholding it, and he will call for a reckoning on the last day. There will be a judgment. When the order works out in  the  here  and  now,  when  fools  are  struck  with  poverty,  lose  their  family,  or irreparably  damage  their  reputation,  that  is  merely  a  foretaste  of  the  ultimate reckoning  they  will  receive  on  the  last  day.  And  when  the  wise  have  plenty,  a happy  family,  and  a  good  standing  in  the  community,  that  also  is  merely  a foretaste  of  the  glory  to  come.  But  even  if  these  things  don't  work  out immediately, God will see to it that they do in the end. Wisdom  has  its  rewards,  and  Solomon  holds  them  out  to  his  son  as  a motivation to get wisdom. If you believe that Wisdom-Jesus-can make good on  these  rewards,  then  you  will  walk  in  these  ways.  The  devious  person-the person who goes against the created order-is detestable to Yahweh (3:32). And judgment will fall on you if you do not follow the golden rule to do unto others "}

This  encourages and  warns  us  that  our  actions  affect  more  than  just  us.  The  sins  of  the  parents will affect the children, and the righteousness of parents trying their best to walk after Jesus will affect them positively. This is language from Deuteronomy 27- 30. There is a choice between blessing (life) and curses (death) in obedience and disobedience.  There  is  a  choice  between  honor  and  dishonor  here  (Prov  3:34- 35). Don't mock or you'll be mocked. Humble yourself to receive grace from the Lord. Conclusion Jesus  is  the  Wisdom  of  God,  but  he's  also  the  wise  son  of  Proverbs  who humbled himself, took on the curse for us, and offers us the blessings of wisdom. He truly is more precious than silver, more costly than gold, and more beautiful than diamonds. As George Beverly Shea used to sing, I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold; I'd rather be His than have riches untold; I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands. I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hand Than to be the king of a vast domain Or be held in sin's dread sway. I'd rather have Jesus than anything This world affords today. (Rhea F. Miller, \"I'd Rather Have Jesus,\" 1922) Yes, riches can be great, long life is something we all hope for, having a good reputation is precious, being able to sleep in peace at night is priceless, but Jesus is better than any and all of these things.

Grow Progressively in Wisdom (4:10-19). love Proverbs because it corrects our misunderstandings about spirituality. We I tend  to  compartmentalize  spirituality  and  push  it  to  the  margins  of  our  lives. We  divide  our  lives  into  our  spiritual  activities  (Sundays  and  maybe Wednesdays) and secular activities (the rest of the week). We think of most of life  as  morally  neutral.  We  think  God  is  more  concerned  with  the  \"spiritual\" things we do than he is with the rest of our lives. We think that God really cares about us having a good devotional time; but he's not necessarily concerned with our jobs or our schools, outside of us trying to be a good witness in those places. We think God is really concerned that I be a witness but he is not as concerned that I show up on time or that I complete my assignments by their due date. Solomon  blows  this  paradigm  apart  in  Proverbs.  The  nitty-gritty  details  of your  daily  life  are  not  morally  neutral.  That's  the  whole  point  of  Proverbs. Wisdom isn't first and foremost tips for daily living that you follow; Wisdom is a person that you know and a path that you then walk. If you lack wisdom in a practical area of your life, it's not just that you are a fool in that area, although you are; you are demonstrating that you have a problem with Jesus.8 If you walk in foolishness, you are walking away from Jesus. If you have a temper problem, you love to argue with people, you go too far with your girlfriend, or you can't see a task your boss assigns you through to completion, those are not just minor character  flaws.  They  reveal  that  you  have  a  problem  with  Jesus.  If  you  find yourself  walking  down  the  wrong  path,  it  reveals  you  are  following  the  wrong person, and that's deadly!

{"Page": 59, "Info": "The  father  again  appeals  to  his  son  to  listen  to  his  instruction  in  order  to  gain understanding (wisdom). Wisdom is dispensed from a parent to a child. He says, \"Listen to me because I have good instruction. Don't abandon it.\" Not only is the wisdom  parental,  but  it  is  multigenerational.  This  was  passed  down  from  his father and mother (i.e., David and Bathsheba). In effect, Solomon says, \"My dad taught me the law as the means to life and establishing the kingdom (see 1 Kgs 2), and now I'm teaching this to you!\" Instruction in wisdom should be a multigenerational thing. Parents have been entrusted with the responsibility of passing this down to their children. We can pass down patterns of foolishness like laziness, addiction, abuse, or passivity. Or we  can  pass  down  patterns  of  wisdom  like  humility,  a  good  work  ethic,  and responsibility. Proverbs 3:33 teaches us that we can bring blessing or cursing on our  house.  The  good  news  is  that  the  chain  of  wickedness  can  be  broken  with one  generation  that  pursues  the  Lord,  but  the  bad  news  is  that  a  chain  of faithfulness  can  be  broken  in  one  generation  as  well.  The  goal  of  Christian parenting is to pass down godly wisdom so that the chain will not be broken by your  children  or  grandchildren.  As  my  friend  Jimmy  Scroggins  has  said,  \"The goal  of  Christian  parenting  is  not  just  Christian  children;  it  is  Christian grandchildren.\" Solomon says that David told him to let his heart keep his commands and live. Again, wisdom is tied to the law, and it must be obeyed from the inside out. It must  be  written  on  the  heart  (  Jer  31:33).  Practically,  wisdom  prolongs  life because it avoids the risky behaviors that bring premature death like addictions, disregarding governmental laws, or disregarding parents by running into traffic. The life that will not heed authoritative counsel will often end early. Eternal and abundant life is found in obedience to the law (Lev 18; Jesus is the fulfillment). So  David  told  Solomon  to  get  wisdom  and  not  to  forsake  her  (4:6).  Again, Wisdom is personified as a woman (i.e., Lady Justice) to get his son to make a decision for wisdom. Ultimately, we New Testament Christians know that this is fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus is the wisdom of Solomon-the Wisdom of God or the law of God-in human flesh. He fulfilled the Proverbs. David exhorts Solomon to begin a relationship with wisdom (i.e., marry her) and never abandon her (i.e., don't be unfaithful to her). He says that she will keep him safe and preserve his life, so he should love her. Again, wisdom is first and foremost a person to be in relationship with, not a set of ideas to live out. Then, according to many English versions, David makes a statement in verse 7 that seems odd. He says, \"The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom\" (ESV). "}
{"Page": 60, "Info": "OK? So you are saying that the first step to getting wisdom is getting wisdom? That's strange. That does not seem all that wise, to be honest. But again, what this  means  is  that  the  first  step  to  being  wise  is  making  a  faith  decision  to commit  to  Wisdom-Jesus.  Other  English  versions  say  something  like, \"Wisdom is supreme-so get wisdom\" (CSB). The point is the same: Wisdom- Jesus-is the most important matter in all of life, so commit to him. So  the  multigenerational  task  is  to  introduce  our  children  to  Jesus  first,  then introduce our grandchildren to Jesus. This is most important. Read the Bible to your  children,  pray  with  them,  bring  them  to  church,  have  family  devotional time,  share  your  testimony  with  them,  let  them  see  you  worship  Jesus  in gatherings, let them see you participate in the ordinances, and share Jesus with them  so  they  can  know  him  intimately.  Then,  based  on  that  relationship  with Jesus and in that framework, teach them practical wisdom like how to be honest, how to fight anxiety, how to handle money, how to avoid get-rich-quick scams, how to receive a rebuke, how to lovingly give a rebuke, how to complete tasks like chores, and a thousand other things. Wisdom begins with a personal relationship with Jesus Christ because wisdom is  not  principles  to  learn.  Wisdom  is  a  person  to  know  and  follow-infinitely superior to Dear Abby tips. Jesus is the pearl of great price. He's the one worth forsaking all else to get. David says to prize Wisdom highly, and she will exalt you,  just  like  the  Lord  in  due  time  exalts  the  humble  (v.  8).  David  uses  the metaphor of the crown  (v. 9) to say that she will honor you (cf. Rev  4:4). She will give you a good public reputation. Wisdom is Jesus Christ, and you have to relate to him above all else! Prize him and he will honor you. "}
{"Page": 61, "Info": "Grow Progressively in Wisdom PROVERBS 4:10-19 In verses 10-19 Solomon again exhorts his son to listen to his wise teaching in order  to  prolong  his  life  (v.  10).  We  have  seen  this  throughout  Proverbs. Solomon  says,  \"I  am  teaching  you  the  way  of  wisdom;  I  am  guiding  you  on straight  paths\"  (v.  11).  This  refers  to  the  wise  course  of  life.  It's  the  ethical course to take because it is the \"straight\" path. Wisdom is a person to know and a path to walk. Solomon says that since his son has embraced Wisdom, now he must  stay  on  the  path  of  wisdom,  that  is,  the  path  of  morality  and  the  safest course (v. 12). Keep hold of Wisdom, and she will be your life (v. 13). Do not walk  on  the  wicked  path  (v.  14).  Again,  wisdom  is  not  intelligence,  and foolishness  is  not  morally  neutral.  The  idiot  friend  on  every  sitcom  is  not  the biblical  picture  of  folly.  Solomon  lays  out  the  \"doctrine  of  two  paths\"  (Fox, Proverbs  1-9,  128-31).  There  are  two  roads  or  ways:  (1)  the  wise,  righteous  path that leads to life and (2) the foolish, wicked path that leads to death. Wisdom  is  a  path  or  course  of  life.  Wisdom  is  a  progressive  thing;  it  is  not something  you  arrive  at.  This  is  very  similar  to  the  New  Testament  idea  of sanctification,  where  we  \"walk\"  in  the  Spirit  (Gal  5:16,25).  You  are  being conformed into the image of Christ, and this will take your whole life. You start down the path through Jesus; after all, he is \"the way\" ( John 14:6). You must know the person of Wisdom to walk in the way of wisdom (Prov 4:13-14). However,  the  path  that  you  progressively  walk  reveals  whom  you  are embracing. Your daily life decisions reveal whether you are following Jesus or walking away from him. The fact that you cannot control your temper with your children, constantly want to argue with your coworkers, go in and out of dumb dating  relationships,  spout  off  at  your  parents,  or  cannot  follow  through  on school work has everything to do with Jesus. It reveals that you've gotten off the path of wisdom and are walking down the foolish path (vv. 11-14). It reveals that you aren't holding onto Wisdom-Jesus (v. 13). Walking the path of wisdom is a lifestyle that avoids the things that lead to an early death. We see this repeatedly. Solomon says when you walk this path you will not stumble (v. 12). There is safety and security on this smooth path. You avoid the obstacles of foolishness. Fools don't see the connection between their foolishness and the consequences. They do not see that their laziness has led to them not having a job. They think their employer mistreated them.

Turn away from it (v. 15).9 When you come to a road that seems right but that will take you off the path that God has revealed, then move on and do not take it. Solomon is setting his son up here in the introduction (Prov 1-9) for  the  sentence  sayings  that  will  come  later  (Prov  10-31).  These  sayings  will contrast  the  way  of  wicked  foolishness  with  the  way  of  righteous  wisdom.  He says there will be things that seem like the right course in life but they are not. It will  seem  like  withholding  discipline  from  your  child  is  loving,  but  it  isn't.  It will seem like hoarding your possessions will give you financial security, but it won't. It will seem like holding your tongue instead of rebuking a friend who is going down the wrong path is the easier and better thing to do at the time-after all, we aren't supposed to judge-but that isn't wise or loving. Don't follow the wicked way that seems right at the time because those on the way  of  evil  eat,  drink,  and  sleep  foolishness  and  wickedness-and  they  want others  to  join  them  (vv.  16-17).  They  will  tempt  you  to  follow  them  into laziness, gossip, quick-temperedness, and other degeneracy. In contrast, the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day (v. 18). The righteous way is a path of progressing in holiness until the last day. Just like the sun is seen at dawn and then gets brighter and brighter until it reaches its zenith, so those who walk on the path of wisdom will see more and more of the path and walk in greater and greater wisdom until the day they are made  truly  wise  in  the  presence  of  Jesus.  The  way  of  the  wicked  is  a  path  of deep darkness where they do not know what they stumble over. I ( Jon) often get dressed in the dark so as not to wake my sleeping family. It is quite  possible  for  me  to  leave  the  house  with  the  wrong  socks  or  some  other wardrobe  mishap.  Solomon  says  wisdom  is  the  remedy  for  that.  Foolishness  is trying to live your life in the darkness. You can't see the way things really are, so you keep ruining your life and falling into misery. But wisdom is like the light of  the  sun  that  shows  you  how  things  really  are,  so  that  you  can  follow progressively the right course in life. The wise path is lit so you can see where you are walking, and the foolish path is dark so you stumble. Wisdom is a lamp -Jesus is the light of the world ( John 8:12)-so you can see the right path to take.  But  if  you  do  not  have  the  light,  you  cannot  see  where  to  walk.  You stumble.

He judges you if you're  naughty,  and  he  rewards  you  if  you're  nice.  Because  of  that misconception, much of modern Christianity consists of behavior modification. Many people think the main message of Christianity is \"Stop doing bad things so God will like you, bless you, and take you to heaven instead of hell when you die. Heaven is for good people, and hell is for bad people; so be a good person and go to heaven not hell.\" There  are  lots  of  problems  with  this  understanding  of  Christianity.  One,  it  is not  biblical.  Another  is  this:  We  cannot  stop  sinning.  We  cannot  perfectly modify  our  behavior.  Isn't  this  clear?  When  I  (  Jon)  was  a  boy,  my  mom  was really concerned about my habit of chewing my nails, and she wanted to rid me of it. So she bought some stuff to rub on my nails that would make them taste yucky  so  I  wouldn't  put  my  fingers  in  my  mouth.  She  wanted  to  modify  my behavior. But instead of helping me quit, over time I began to like the taste of what  she  rubbed  on  my  nails.  Has  there  ever  been  something  like  this  in  your life? A habit you can't seem to break? It does not matter how many patches for tobacco they come out with or how many paleo diets you see, you cannot seem to  change  over  the  long  haul.

In the same way, has there ever been a sinful or foolish behavior in your life that  you  just  could  not  stop?  You  may  have  even  begged  God  to  take  it  away. You know it's wrong, destructive, sinful, and unwise, but you just can't stop. It's a continual struggle. There are sin patterns that we try to break but can't. We try to modify the behavior.

Things go well for a little while, but then you learn to get around the software, or you look at it on your phone. Or you've got a problem with your temper. You explode in anger at your children. So in order to modify the behavior, you decide you'll count to ten  before  responding  to  anything.  But  sometimes  you  forget  to  count  because you're just so angry. Why  don't  these  things  work?  As  one  pastor  said,  behavior  modification  is like mowing dandelions. You can mow over the dandelions, and your lawn will look good; but a day or two later the dandelions have popped up again because you didn't address the root. Behavior modification treats the surface issue, but it does not dig down to the source. The problem is in our heart-that is the source. If  we  do  not  deal  with  sin  and  foolishness  at  the  heart  level,  then  even  if  we mightily try to modify the behavior, it will find new ways to pop out in our lives. So if you have a problem with addiction to alcohol, your primary problem is a lack of self-control. You may modify the alcoholism, but if you do not address the  root  issue  of  self-control,  the  alcohol  problem  will  come  back  or  the  self- control issue will resurface with smoking, overeating, or taking painkillers. This  is  a  problem  for  all  of  us.  We  are  all  sinners  by  nature,  so  we  are  all broken  at  the  heart  level  and  bent  toward  sin.  That  means  we  love  things  that God  hates,  and  we  hate  things  that  God  loves.  So  we  can  try  to  modify  the behavior,  but  it  won't  bring  lasting  change  because  we  are  only  treating  the symptoms and not the source. The  behavior  modification  approach  to  Christianity  has  brought  a  lot  of heartache.  Behavior  modification  can  either  lead  to  depression  when  you  can't fully  address  your  problems  or  pride  if  you  are  able  to  solve  your  problems. These are both problematic. The answer for us according to Proverbs 4:20-27 is not behavior modification; it's that we need a new heart because the heart is the command center for life. The heart is the source for every behavior in your life, so  in  order  to  address  sin  and  foolishness  we  must  address  them  at  the  heart level.

{"Page": 68, "Info": "son must daily live the law by walking in righteousness. But he must have a new heart with the law written on it to do so. The father again appeals to his son to embrace his teachings. He emphasizes body  parts  here  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  294).  He  says,  \"Give  your  ear  to my sayings, don't let them escape your eyes, and keep them in your heart\" (vv. 20-21;  authors'  translation).  The  \"sayings\"  refer  to  the  teaching  of  Proverbs. Solomon is advising his son, and us through the Spirit, to learn the doctrine of Proverbs  (i.e.,  control  your  tongue,  have  a  good  work  ethic,  save  money,  do good to your neighbor, etc.). Wisdom  is  a  process  of  receiving  the  right  words  and  listening  to  the  right voice. There is a necessity of belief because you will continue to listen to the one you trust. Whose voice and what messages do you listen to? There are so many competing  messages  for  Solomon's  son.  There  are  messages  coming  from  the mouths of God, his father, counselors, peers, the forbidden woman, and others. They are all competing for the son's attention. They all want his heart. The same is  true  for  us.  There  are  songs,  movies,  shows,  books,  peers,  neighbors, coworkers, parents, and family members speaking into our lives. They try to tell us what to do, how to think, and what decisions will be wise. It can be anything from what product to put in your hair to what relationships you should pursue. But  which  ones  you  listen  to  is  of  vital  importance  because  messages  go  in your  ear  and  then  down  into  your  heart  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  295-96). Your ears and eyes are the gates to your heart. This is why what you listen to and what you look at are so important. The songs you hear, the sermons, the sitcoms, and many other sources shape you. They are powerful, and they can capture you and  get  you  to  believe  things.  Are  you  listening  to  the  voice  of  God  mediated through  Solomon?  Is  God's  Word  the  ultimate  authority  and  final  word  on  the matters of your life? Or are you listening to the voice of Folly? Are you listening to  messages  that  have  the  influence  of  Satan  standing  behind  them?  Are  you listening to what will lead you astray? This is true of listening with the ear, but it is also true of seeing with the eye. What you see will also go down into your heart. So commit yourself to listen to and read wisdom so that it will shape your heart. Don't just hear or read it; work it down into your heart so it can bring lasting change. This means that you must know  wisdom,  memorize  wisdom,  and  meditate  on  it.  Meditate  and  identify what idols or values in your heart are keeping you from walking in wisdom. Yes, the  work  of  God  is  necessary  to  change  your  heart  as  we  will  see,  but  there  is also work for you to do on your heart. "}
{"Page": 69, "Info": "Words must go in your ear or eye and down into your heart for you to obey the wisdom  of  God.  The  law-wisdom-must  be  written  on  the  heart.  This  is  a constant theme in Proverbs. Wisdom must enter your heart to keep you from evil (2:10; 3:1; etc.). Proverbs 3:3 and 7:3 say the wise teaching must be written on the  \"tablet  of  your  heart.\"  Like  the  Ten  Commandments  were  written  on  stone tablets, the wisdom of Proverbs must be written on your heart in order for you to walk in it (cf. Jer 31). Why  should  you  listen  to  his  words  and  receive  them  in  your  heart?  You should  receive  them  because  they  are  life  and  health  (Prov  4:22).  Wisdom reverses the curse of death. We've seen this before: wisdom is a return to Eden -to  paradise.  Wisdom  reverses  the  curse's  effects  on  the  course  of  your  life. But these things must be written on your heart for you to obey these commands and receive these benefits because the heart is the command center for your life. Your Heart Is the Command Center for Your Life PROVERBS 4:23 This  is  one  of  the  key  verses  to  understanding  Proverbs  and  all  of  life.  Guard your  heart  because  from  it  flow  the  springs  of  life.  The  heart  is  the  key  and source to everything in your life. The heart is the source of the river of your life; it's the command center. Everything you do flows from your heart. The way you think,  talk,  and  act  flows  from  your  heart.  The  heart  is  the  agent  governing  all your body's actions. But we have a problem. We have broken and sinful hearts that lead us astray. We inherited this heart from Adam. Proverbs 22:15 says, \"Foolishness is bound to the heart of a youth.\" Proverbs 20:9 says, \"Who can say, \u2018I have kept my heart pure;  I  am  cleansed  from  my  sin'?\"  The  answer  is,  no  one!  Proverbs  28:26 makes clear, \"He who trusts in his own heart is a fool\" (NASB). Your heart will lead you astray, so \"follow your heart\" or \"trust your feelings\" is stupid advice. The reason we have bad behavior is because the source of our behavior-our heart-is bad. Jesus teaches this in Matthew 12:33-37. Either make the tree good and its fruit will be good, or make the tree bad and its fruit will be bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. Brood of vipers! How can you speak good things when you are evil? For the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart. A good person produces good things from his storeroom of good, and an evil person produces evil things from his storeroom of evil. I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned. Proverbs and Jesus tell us that sin starts in the heart before it manifests itself in our  behavior.  All  throughout  Proverbs  Scripture  tells  us  that  lust,  perversion, "}
{"Page": 70, "Info": "deceit, anxiety, backsliding, pride, jealousy, and wrong speech reside first in the heart. Jesus makes this clear again in Mark 7:20-23. And he said, \"What comes out of a person is what defiles him. For from within, out of people's hearts, come evil thoughts, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries, greed, evil actions, deceit, self-indulgence, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness. All these evil things come from within and defile a person.\" Behavior modification is a joke that is not funny. The Pharisees were good at it, and Jesus called them evil. Why? Because Jesus is concerned with the heart- with our motives and attitudes-not just our outward actions. Jesus says in the Sermon on the Mount that sexual sin does not start with the outward act; it starts in the heart, and we will be judged for that! But not only will we be judged for it later; we also will not be able to see lasting change now. If all we do is modify behavior but leave the source issue untouched in our hearts, it will spring up and break  out  elsewhere.  What's  in  the  heart  will  come  out  in  words,  actions,  and course of life. It is inevitable. Both Solomon and Jesus are clear on this. Your  behavior  reveals  the  state  of  your  heart.  Outward  gossip  can  reveal jealousy, bitterness, or pride in the heart. Adultery or pornography reveals lust in the heart. For real and lasting change to happen in your life, you need to assess what's happening in your heart. Maybe your money problems can be traced back to  a  lack  of  contentment  in  God  in  your  heart.  Maybe  the  lies  you  tell  reveal insecurity in your heart where you worship the approval of others. Examine your heart to figure out the motivations for your behavior. Since we all have heart issues, we need new hearts for real and lasting change. Deuteronomy  said  that  we  fail  to  obey  the  law  because  we  lack  the  hearts  to obey (Deut 5:29; 10:6; 29:3). But it also promised that one day the Lord would perform an inner transformation of the heart that would enable obedience (Deut 30:6). This promise is repeated in Ezekiel where the Lord says he will give his follower a new heart (Ezek 36:26) and in Jeremiah where the Lord says he will write  the  law  on  our  hearts  (  Jer  31:33).  Proverbs  promises  the  same-a  new heart with the law written on it (Prov 3:3; 7:3). Foolishness, or \"lacking sense,\" is described in the Hebrew of Proverbs as literally \"lacking a heart\" (6:32; 7:7; 9:4;  10:13;  11:12;  12:11;  17:18;  24:30;  cf.  Deut  5:29).  The  adulterer  lacks  a heart (Prov 6:32; 7:7). Woman Wisdom and Woman Folly seek the affection of the one who lacks heart (9:4,16). The one who lacks heart will die (10:21). The lazy  fool  is  one  who  lacks  a  heart  (24:30).  In  contrast,  the  wise  person  who listens to wisdom \"acquires\" a heart (15:32; cf. Ezek 36:26). So we need to be born again with a new heart-a new source of power we did not have before. This happens through belief in Jesus. Once you trust Christ for "}
{"Page": 71, "Info": "salvation,  you  are  born  again  and  given  new  appetites  for  God,  his  Word,  his church. You're not given perfection-yet-but you are being changed. Solomon warns us to guard our hearts. Guard what you hear and see-what you allow into your heart-because it will have a tremendous impact on the course of your life. After all, the heart is the command center for your life. Your Behavior Reveals the Condition of Your Heart PROVERBS 4:24-27 In the last section of Proverbs 4 Solomon says that our actions reveal what is in our hearts. He starts in verse 24 with our words. Your mouth reveals the state of your heart (Wiersbe,  Be  Skillful, 53). He tells his son to put away devious speech. This is a command for good behavior, but the son will only be able to obey it if he has guarded his heart. You must have a new heart-and guard that heart (v. 23)-to keep your tongue in check (cf. Jas 3). Evil speech reflects an evil heart. If  you  use  your  speech  to  hurt  others,  deceive  others,  gossip  about  others,  or falsely flatter others, then it's the overflow of a sinful heart. Again, Jesus told us this  clearly  in  Matthew  12:34-\"The  mouth  speaks  from  the  overflow  of  the heart.\"  Jesus  says  that  our  words  will  justify  or  condemn  us  on  judgment  day. That's not because good works-or good speech in this case-gets us to heaven. It is because your speech reveals whether or not Jesus has changed your heart! This  is  also  true  of  our  actions-the  course  of  our  life  (Prov  4:25-27).  You must  have  the  right  heart  to  stay  on  the  right  path  where  things  will  go  well. Solomon exhorts his son to keep his eyes on the path (v. 25) because if he gets distracted, he will swerve off the path and injure himself. When my twin brother and  I  (  Jon)  were  very  little  we  lived  in  a  parsonage  across  the  street  from  the church where our dad was on staff. We were poor and could not afford even a plastic  pool,  so  on  warm  days  our  mom  would  turn  on  the  sprinkler,  and  we would strip down to our birthday suits and run through the water. One day we were doing this when a ladies' Bible study let out at the church. A lady was so distracted by the naked jaybirds across the street that she walked into a telephone pole and split her head open. Solomon warns his son not to get distracted and go off the path into the danger zone. If you do find your foot slipping, then repent- turn away from evil (v. 27). Again, we will not be perfect in this life. That's not the expectation. But there should be gradual, sanctifying change in the course of our lives. If there is not, there is the danger of judgment. Solomon is very concerned that his son get this-and we need to get it too- because we cannot walk in the wisdom of Proverbs 10-31 that leads to life if we "}

{"Page": 73, "Info": "Conclusion Change must take place at the heart level. That, not behavior modification, is the message of Christianity. You need to be born again by Jesus, and then the Spirit of Jesus will empower you to work on your heart issues. Proverbs hopes for this here, and Jesus gives it. This is absolutely critical because Jesus says that only the pure in heart will see God. That means that we have a big problem because our hearts aren't pure (20:9). But here is the good news: Jesus lived the life you couldn't live, died the death you should've died, and was raised from the dead. He  will  grant  his  Spirit  and  a  new  heart  to  all  who  believe  in  him.  He  will account  you  righteous  before  God,  and  then  he  will  begin  the  work  of progressively  growing  you  in  righteousness  by  the  power  of  his  Spirit  through the  Word.  So  it's  OK  to  not  be  OK,  but  it's  not  OK  to  stay  that  way.  Ask yourself some probing questions: Do I have a new heart? What do my struggles reveal about my heart? Then ask Jesus to change you at the heart level. He can. He will. "}

Horizontally, be satisfied in your spouse (5:15-20). B. Vertically, be in a saving relationship with Jesus (7:4). few  years  ago  a  pastor  friend  of  mine  walked  away  from  his  wife  and A children for a woman on his staff. When he was confronted about his sin, his response  was,  \"I  know  it's  wrong,  but  I'm  going  to  do  it  anyway.  I  know  that God will forgive me.\" This was obviously devastating to his wife, his children, and his church. It was heartbreaking, but it did not happen overnight. This pastor had developed a problem with porn at the age of twelve. There were times when it was worse than others. There were times that he got caught, repented, sought counseling, and seemed to be freed of it. But something that started out as small as a few looks at a magazine as a pubescent boy ended up destroying his family and ministry. Sexual sin is so seductive and dangerous because it can start out small and in many  cases  is  seemingly  innocent,  and  then  before  you  know  it  your  life  has been ruined. You may think to yourself, \"What's the harm in this relationship? What's  the  harm  in  a  little  innocent  flirting?  I'll  never  do  anything  anyway.\" You  will  destroy  your  life,  and  you  won't  even  see  it  coming.10  Sexual  sin  is appealing; it promises pleasure and happiness and can even deliver it for a little while, but then it kills you. Sexual sin may cause you to walk away from God, or at  least  redefine  \"God\"  as  someone  who  is  OK  with  your  sin.  Sexual  sin  may cost you your family, your reputation, and the respect of your children; or it may just warp your ideas of intimacy in marriage and drive a wedge between you and "}
{"Page": 76, "Info": "your wife (or your future wife). There are a thousand different ways that sexual sin can destroy you, but make no mistake-it will. Sexual  sin  is  not  something  to  flirt  with  or  to  keep  secret  and  hope  it  goes away before someone finds out. It's a killer. Solomon warns us repeatedly about this in Proverbs 5-7. Don't Fall into Sexual Sin Solomon  knows  this  topic  well  since  he  repeatedly  messed  up  big  time  with \"forbidden\"  women  (see  1  Kgs  11:3;  he  had  seven  hundred  wives  and  three hundred concubines). He warns his son not to fall for the forbidden or immoral woman  (i.e.,  sexual  sin).  This  is  a  parental  responsibility  dads  and  moms  have with their children (Prov 6:20). You should have \"the talk\" with your children; in fact, you should have multiple talks. Solomon speaks continuously to his son throughout  this  book.  Parent,  you  need  to  be  the  expert  on  sex  with  your children.  Do  not  abdicate  that  responsibility  to  TV,  the  Internet,  or  your children's peers simply because talking about it may be \"weird.\" And churches also  need  to  be  experts  on  sex  instead  of  avoiding  the  subject.  God  talks  a  lot about it. Sex is a powerful gift from God, and we need to proclaim the beauty of sex in marriage as Solomon does here (and also in the Song of Songs). He  warns  his  son  because  the  lips  of  an  immoral  woman  drip  honey;  her speech is smoother than oil (5:3).11 She is a rival to the father (and Wisdom) for the son's affection. Who will the son listen to? Which speech will he heed? Who will you listen to? Let's note an important caveat. This figure of the immoral woman stands for very real sexual sin that the son can commit with a woman. But Solomon is not absolving  the  son  of  his  part  in  this,  nor  is  he  making  a  statement  about  any predatory makeup of women. This is a father talking to his son, so the figure he will  warn  him  about  is  a  woman.  If  he  were  talking  to  his  daughter,  he  would talk about an immoral man. The fact is men do this kind of predatory seduction more than women! This section applies to women too. They just need to reverse the image (Longman, Proverbs, 164-65). The son is not an innocent bystander in all of this. We will see that a senseless young man flirts with this (Prov 7). He may loathe his decision later, but he is culpable. And not only can you be preyed on by an immoral man or woman, but you  also  can  be  the  immoral  aggressor  or  predator.  The  issue  cuts  both  ways with both sexes. "}
{"Page": 77, "Info": "Solomon is warning his son about any sexual activity outside the covenant of marriage. Any sexual activity that is not with your heterosexual spouse is sin and will destroy you, your marriage, or your future marriage. That includes adultery, lust,  fantasies,  pornography,  fooling  around,  cohabitation,  and  homosexuality. Solomon  warns  his  son  of  two  specific  ways  that  he  can  be  tempted  to  fall: words and looks. Words (5:1-4; 6:24; 7:1-5) First, he mentions words. He says in verse 3 her lips drip honey. (Lips may imply the  desire  to  kiss  her;  cf.  Song  4:11.  Actually,  there  may  even  be  a  triple entendre  here;  Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  308-9.)  She's  a  charmer  with  her words,  and  yes,  men  can  do  this  too.  Communication  is  the  first  way  you  are drawn  into  sexual  sin  (Prov  6:24).  Alluring  words  pull  you  away  from  your marriage vows. This is true for men because they are suckers for flattery and for women  because  they  are  creatures  of  the  ear.  Sexual  unfaithfulness  starts  with communication.  The  communication  may  seem  innocent  enough  at  first.  The woman  in  the  cubicle  beside  you  laughs  at  your  jokes.  The  old  boyfriend  on Facebook  interacts  with  you  at  a  level  that  makes  you  feel  important.  Your friend at the gym seems to understand you better than your wife. You think to yourself that a few text messages back and forth, even if they are a little flirty in nature, are not that big a deal. \"Well, I would not be doing this if my husband would just listen to me.\" \"Well, my wife does not admire me like she does.\" If this  is  happening  in  your  life,  you  should  hear  the  Jaws  theme  music  in  the background. Repeatedly emailing, texting, calling, or meeting up with someone of  the  opposite  sex  who  is  not  your  spouse  is  a  major  issue.  It  is  massively stupid!  You  may  think  it  is  harmless,  but  you  are  wrong.  You  are  forging  an emotional intimacy through communication that can lead to more. The smooth words may not be the communication of an individual; they may be  messages  you  are  being  bombarded  with  in  the  culture:  \"Don't  get  married too young. Delay marriage as long as you can so that you know you are ready.\" This causes unfaithfulness to your future spouse as you fool around right now. \"It's  OK  to  mess  around.  How  else  will  you  know  what  you  like  sexually?\" \"Guys  like  girls  who  are  more  sexually  active.  If  you  don't  act  somewhat aggressive, he won't want you.\" Wrong! The lies of culture enter your ear and heart:  \"Infidelity  is  hotter  than  monogamy.\"  \"Follow  your  heart.\"  \"Do  what makes you happy.\" Maybe the message is in your own head: \"My spouse isn't as romantic with me as she should be, so . . .\" "}
{"Page": 78, "Info": "For  some  women  it  might  be  reading  romance  novels.  You  read  the  Twilight novels or Fifty Shades of Grey. These books cause you to emotionally invest in a man who is not your husband. They cause you to be dissatisfied with your husband. \"I wish my husband was more sensitive to my needs like the man in this book.\" \"I  wish  my  husband  was  romantic  like  this  man  in  the  book.\"  \"I  wish  my husband listened to my inmost thoughts like the man in this book.\" This is also the  seduction  of  pornography  whether  in  picture  or  print.  Porn  offers,  to  men, women  who  act  more  like  men  (i.e.,  sexually  aggressive)  and,  to  women,  men who  act  like  more  like  women  (i.e.,  emotionally  sensitive).  This  causes  you  to paint  a  picture  in  your  mind  of  the  ideal  spouse.  If  that  picture  is  not  your spouse, you are in danger! Guys  can  talk  smoothly  to  girls  to  get  them  into  bed.  They  will  feed  them whatever line they have to in order to get sex: \"If you love me, then . . . No one will find out . . . I love you more than I've ever loved anyone before.\" Sexual sin starts with communication-with words. In  Proverbs  7  Solomon  gives  a  story  that  focuses  on  this  woman's  smooth words.  From  his  house,  Solomon  watches  a  na\u00efve  young  man.  He  sees  him flirting with sexual sin by going close to this woman's house (7:7-8). So many of us  ask  those  kinds  of  questions:  \"Where's  the  line?  How  far  is  too  far?  How close can I get without going too far?\" Solomon tells his son to keep far from her -flee from this temptation (5:8). But he is in the wrong place at the wrong time with  the  wrong  person,  so  the  wrong  thing  happens.  She  flatters  him  with  her words:  \"You're  the  one  for  me.  I've  gotta  have  you,  big  boy\"  (7:13-18).  She inflates  his  ego  perhaps  in  a  way  that  his  wife  hasn't.  She  even  uses  religious talk  to  ease  his  conscience  (7:14).  \"God  won't  be  mad;  I've  already  offered sacrifices at the temple. We can be forgiven.\" She also assures him that no one will find out. \"We won't get caught. No one has to know\" (7:19-20). This is a lie. This sin is always found out. Someone knows about it. At my first church a guy came to me to confess that he had cheated on his wife. I told him to come clean with her. He said he needed time. I told him that she was going to find out, and it would be worse if he did not confess. He thought there was no way she could find out since only he and the woman knew. But the woman's ex-husband found  out  and  called  my  church  member's  wife  while  their  entire  family  was driving back from vacation. He was busted. This will be found out; and even if it is  not  in  this  life,  God  is  watching  (5:21).  Yet  the  seductive  speech  persuades this young man, and he yields to temptation (7:22). Looks (6:25) "}
{"Page": 79, "Info": "Solomon  says  that  besides  words  there  is  a  second  means  that  allures  you  to unfaithfulness, and that is looks. Attraction draws you into sexual sin. Solomon warns his son in Proverbs 6:25, \"Don't lust in your heart for her beauty.\" Lust starts  in  the  heart  before  the  act.  Jesus  also  tells  us  this  in  Matthew  5.  We  see things with our eyes, and it draws us away from our spouse. It starts fantasies in the mind. It might be pornography, inappropriate TV shows, or sexually explicit movies.  Porn  is  a  brutal  killer  right  now  because  you  can  get  it  on  your  cell phone, iPad, or computer with little effort. This should be a warning to parents about giving their children unfettered access to the Internet. Really think before you give your children a smart phone. Porn  is  deadly  not  just  because  it  causes  fantasies  but  also  because  it  warps one's view of marriage and sex. Porn addicts begin to view sex as a completely selfish  act  that  is  about  my  pleasure  rather  than  the  pleasure  of  another.  Porn viewing  causes  you  to  train  yourself  to  experience  stimulation  and  pleasure outside  the  covenant  of  marriage.  Then,  when  you  do  get  married,  you  bring those fantasies into the marriage. As one author asked, \"How would you like it if Hugh  Hefner  could  view  your  wife's  naked  body  and  look  it  up  and  down?\" That's exactly what's happening when you look at her because you've brought your  pornographic  viewing  into  the  marriage.  You  treat  her  as  an  object (Challies,  Sexual  Detox).12  Men  especially  are  creatures  of  sight,  so  be  on  guard about what you look at. Also, we need to say a word to women and parents about modesty.  Christian  sisters  can  help  their  brothers  out  by  following  the  biblical guidelines for modesty. And parents, especially dads who know how men view women: do not let your daughters dress immodestly. You are inviting disaster! You are not loving your precious daughters as you ought. The slide toward sexual sin starts gradually by what you hear and look at. And it ends in disaster. It may start out with simply fooling around while dating and assuaging  your  guilt  by  saying,  \"Well,  at  least  we  aren't  going  \u2018all  the  way.'\" But you are training yourself to experience and enjoy sexual contact outside the covenant of marriage. What makes you think that once you are in that covenant you  will  be  able  to  keep  your  vows,  since  you  were  not  faithful  to  your  future spouse?  Facebook  in  this  context  can  also  be  a  big  killer.  People  rekindle  old flames on Facebook. Ashley and I ( Jon) have each other's Facebook passwords and can look at each other's stuff anytime we want. This isn't because we lack trust; it's because we have nothing to hide. Solomon  appeals  to  his  son  by  saying  basically,  \"Listen  to  me,  not  her.\"  He says, \"Keep your way far from her\" (5:8). Paul says, \"Flee sexual immorality!\" "}

Solomon is actually talking in 5:9- 14 about the forbidden woman's pimp or her husband taking revenge, but these consequences are generic enough to apply to all of us. They seem very similar to the  covenant  curses  of  Deuteronomy  28.  When  you  obey  God  you  will experience blessings that you did not work for, but when you disobey him even what you have worked for will go to another. You will give the best part of you to someone it does not belong to (Prov 5:10). You will waste your time, energy, and  resources.  Porn  is  a  current  example  of  an  incredible  waste  of  time  when you could have been producing or providing for your family. Solomon says you will lose your money (in modern cases, alimony and child support). If you fall for  this,  someone  else  will  kiss  your  wife  and  tuck  your  kids  in  at  night-as Toby Keith sings about in \"Who's That Man?\" You  may  lose  your  health  (v.  11;  perhaps  an  STD).  You  will  be  filled  with regret that you did not listen when you had the chance (vv. 12-13). It's foolish to not listen to a rebuke. Perhaps your wife came to you with concerns about a new relationship  you  were  developing,  and  you  responded  to  her  in  anger.  \"You're crazy. You don't know what you're talking about. Stop making a big deal out of this. There's nothing there.\" You attacked her and made her feel like an idiot for her concern. Do you get defensive when confronted on these things? If so, you are  the  idiot!  This  is  your  wife  or  your  husband  protecting  you.  You  were convinced they were overreacting, but now you wish you had listened! You may also experience public disgrace and shame in the assembly (v. 14). Solomon says in Proverbs 6:20-35 that sexual sin may cost you your life. He speaks practically about the cost of adultery. He says the price for a prostitute is like the cost of bread (v. 26). He is not condoning prostitution. He is just saying that it is less costly because it usually destroys just one family whereas adultery destroys two families. He says adultery is more costly because it may cost you your life (v. 34). I heard the story of a man who went into a Sunday school class to beat up a man who had an affair with his wife. Revenge is a reality! Sexual sin may just cost your life as you know it. You lose the respect of your children  or  you  lose  your  family.  But  it  may  cost  you  your  physical  life  if  the husband  wants  revenge.  You  cannot  play  with  fire  without  getting  burned; "}
{"Page": 82, "Info": "likewise, you cannot mess with sexual sin without it wrecking your life (vv. 27- 28).  This  wound  of  shame,  disgrace,  and  possible  death  is  not  worth  a  few minutes  of  pleasure.  And  the  biggest  problem  is  that  these  temporal consequences  are  not  even  the  worst  part.  They  are  just  a  foretaste  of  hell because the wages of sexual sin is death (Rom 6:23). Sexual Sin Will Destroy You Eternally (5:21-23; 7:10-27) Even if you do not die now, you will die later. This sin seems so appealing and sweet like honey, but in the end it is bitter and deadly (5:3-5). Proverbs 7:22-23 pictures this as an ignorant cow being led along to become a steak for someone's dinner,  an  oblivious  deer  that  is  shot  through  the  vitals  by  a  hunter,  or  an unsuspecting bird that gets trapped. These poor, stupid animals were just going about their business and did not know that one second later their life would be over! Solomon  says  not  to  be  intoxicated  with  this  sexual  sin  because  the  Lord  is watching (5:21). If you think no one will find out, you are foolish. God sees all of our sexual sin. We will be held accountable for it on judgment day. It will not go unnoticed. Even if by chance we avoid all of the consequences in this life, we will not avoid judgment. The church has been too focused lately on self-help. So we often merely talk about sexual sin at the level of temporal consequences. Our appeal is to our self-centeredness: \"C'mon, you don't want to get pregnant, do you? You don't want to get an STD, do you? You don't want to ruin intimacy for your future marriage, do you? You don't want to lose your money, do you?\" We  are  so  afraid  to  use  the  word  hell  because  we  don't  want  to  seem  old- fashioned. But  we need  to use  this  word because  sexual sin  will  drag  us  there. Solomon  makes  this  clear  throughout  Proverbs  5-7.  This  raises  an  important question. How Do We Fight It? Solomon  gives  us  two  ways  to  fight  this  sin:  vertical  and  horizontal.  Your vertical  relationship  with  the  Lord  must  be  right  in  order  for  your  horizontal relationship with your spouse to be right. These work in concert. Horizontally, Be Satisfied in Your Spouse (5:15-20) The antidote to sexual sin is to be sexually active with your wife. True intimacy is  found  in  exclusivity.  You  become  an  expert  on  one  person  that  you  are committed  to  for  a  lifetime.  You  might  say,  \"Well,  I'm  trapped  in  a  loveless marriage right now.\" The truth is that if you will remain faithful and exclusive, "}
{"Page": 83, "Info": "over  time  intimacy  will  develop.  That  does  not  mean  that  you  should  not  seek counsel  or  that  there  are  not  things  to  work  on,  but  do  not  give  up  on  God's picture. Paul utilizes the same strategy as Solomon. In 1 Corinthians 6 he exhorts the Corinthians  to  flee  sexual  immorality,  and  in  1  Corinthians  7  he  says  to  enjoy sex  regularly  in  marriage.  He  says  it  is  dangerous  to  withhold  sex  from  one another. If you are not having sex regularly in marriage, that is a danger sign. It can destroy your marriage. Sexual intimacy binds you together with your spouse in a way you are not bound with anyone else. You must develop this part of your marriage.  Meet  your  spouse's  needs  rather  than  insisting  on  your  needs  being met  (Phil  2:3-5).  Practically:  Do  not  sleep  in  separate  rooms.  Do  getaways without the children. Be gracious and kind to one another. Solomon  uses  graphic  imagery  when  he  says,  \"Drink  water  from  your  own cistern\"  (v.  15;  cf.  Song  1:2-3;  4:1-7).  He  says,  \"Take  pleasure  in  the  wife  of your  youth\"  (v.  18;  you  got  married  young,  and  you're  still  together!).  He exhorts  his  son  to  be  intoxicated  with  her  breasts  and  her  love  (5:19).  As Tremper  Longman  said,  \"The  best  defense  against  committing  adultery  is  a strong  offense  in  marriage\"  (Proverbs,  158).  Solomon  does  not  even  mention procreation  here.  Experiencing  regular  sexual  pleasure  in  marriage  will  guard against unfaithfulness. If  you're  not  married,  this  counsel  in  Proverbs  can  also  refer  to  your  future wife. Marry young. Do not delay marriage. Do  not  \"just  say  no\"  in  regard  to  sex  when  you  talk  about  it  with  your children. The \"no\" alone will not work because sex is too powerful. The church has  often  neglected  our  duty  to  talk  about  this  topic  that  is  all  over  the  Bible. God gave sex as a good gift to be enjoyed in marriage. So instead of \"just saying no\" with your kids, point them to the beauty of marriage and the goodness of sex in  marriage.  Yes,  of  course  the  culture  downplays  marriage  because  it  is  a picture of the gospel (Eph 5). But we need to tell our kids that their desires and urges teach them they are meant to be married. Vertically, Be in a Saving Relationship with Jesus (7:4) The  immoral  woman  is  the  rival  to  the  father.  She  is  the  rival  to  Woman Wisdom.  Whom  will  the  son  listen  to?  Whom  will  he  embrace?  This  immoral woman  is  a  major  character  in  Proverbs.  She  stands  for  a  literal  person  with whom the son can be sexually unfaithful. However, later she will be personified as Woman Folly, the rival to Woman Wisdom (Prov 9). If the son embraces this "}
{"Page": 84, "Info": "forbidden woman, it will reveal that he has rejected his father, Woman Wisdom, and Yahweh himself. Sexual sin and spiritual sin are tied together throughout the Bible. Adultery is the distortion of the most intimate human relationship, and it is  used  as  a  metaphor  to  speak  of  the  distortion  of  our  relationship  to  God. Idolatry is spiritual unfaithfulness. That's the whole point of Proverbs 1-9. If our horizontal relationships are off, it reveals that our vertical relationship with God is off as well. Solomon knows this because the \"foreign women\" he was intimate with  led  him  into  idolatry.  Falling  for  this  woman  would  reveal  that  the  son  is not in right relationship with the Lord. So  yes,  there  is  a  real  adulteress  who  can  tempt  the  son,  but  Woman  Folly stands  behind  that  adulteress.  In  the  context  of  the  whole  Bible,  we  know  that Woman Wisdom points to Jesus, and we will see that Woman Folly stands for Satan. (Longman, How to Read Proverbs, lays out this case.) There is a personal being that stands behind the people or things that would tempt you to sexual sin. Satan wants to destroy you and drag you to hell. One of the ways that he most often attacks is sexual sin. If you are not experiencing regular sex with your spouse, there is room for Satan to tempt you (1 Cor 7:5). He and his minions observe the things  that  entice  you  and  bring  you  pleasure,  and  when  the  time  is  right  they might just offer them to you in order to ruin you. The whole point of Proverbs 1-9 is the father trying to get the son to be in a relationship with Wisdom instead of Folly. That's the question: \"Whom will you choose  to  follow?  Whom  will  you  choose  to  marry?\"  You  cannot  walk  in wisdom in terms of sexual ethics if you are not in a right relationship with Jesus. Your  vertical  relationship  will  affect  your  horizontal  marriage,  and  vice  versa. So Solomon says, marry Wisdom-Jesus. That may seem like strong language, but  that  is  precisely  the  antidote  to  sexual  sin.  He  says  to  call  Wisdom  \"my sister\"  (7:4).  That  may  seem  weird,  but  that  is  exactly  what  Solomon  calls  his bride  (Song  4:9-5:2).  You  must  be  in  a  one-flesh  union  with  Christ.  Through believing the gospel you can become a part of Christ's bride-the church. Once  you  are  part  of  Christ's  body,  the  law  of  the  parents  is  written  on  the tablet of your heart (Prov 7:1-3) so that you can obey and live a life of safety in terms of sexual ethics. Those who fall for sexual sin lack the heart necessary to obey God (6:32 literally says in the Hebrew, \"The one committing adultery with a woman lacks a heart\"). You need to meet Jesus and get a new heart with new desires, so that you can live up to the sexual ethic laid out in Proverbs. "}
{"Page": 85, "Info": "Conclusion God created his world good and everything worked right, including relationships and sex. But sin broke our relationship with God and with each other, so nothing right  now  works  as  it  was  designed.  Instead  of  intimacy  and  satisfaction  in marriage, there are distrust, barriers, and unfaithfulness. Sex is still a good, God- given  gift,  but  it  is  not  used  properly  because  we  are  sinners.  Fire  can  be  both good and destructive. When it is in a fireplace it can warm a house so you do not freeze in the winter, but when it is outside the fireplace it will destroy the house. Like  a  fire,  sex  is  very  good  in  the  right  context  (i.e.,  marriage)  but  very destructive  in  the  wrong  context.  Because  of  our  sinful  nature,  we  use  sex  in destructive ways that God never intended. Because of human sin, our vertical relationship with the Lord is off; and as a result  so  are  our  horizontal  relationships  like  marriage.  We  need  to  be  brought back  into  right  relationship  with  God  in  order  for  our  marriages  to  work properly. That's the point of Proverbs. Your relationship with the Lord-fear of Yahweh-is  directly  connected  with  your  relationship  with  your  spouse. Solomon  understands  this  full  well,  and  that  is  why  in  Proverbs  1-9  he constantly  talks  about  our  spiritual relationships (Wisdom or Folly; Yahweh or idols), and he speaks of our practical relationships (wife or immoral woman). Each relationship has a direct effect on the  other.  If  your  spiritual  relationship  is  off,  it  can  destroy  the  practical,  and vice versa! Solomon's heart was pulled toward other women, and his heart was pulled toward idols! two  relationships.  He  talks  about  Here's  the  good  news:  Jesus  Christ-the  Wisdom  of  God-went  into  Sheol for  our  sexual  sin,  and  he  came  back  victorious  three  days  later.  Through  his death  and  resurrection,  we  can  be  reconciled  to  God.  In  Christ,  there  is  no condemnation  for  our  sexual  sin.  And  by  the  power  of  Christ's  Spirit  and  our new hearts, we can be transformed to live out God's plan for our lives, including sexually. That is good news indeed! "}

What qualities attracted you to her? This is the question that Solomon wants to answer for his son in Proverbs 8. Solomon has told us repeatedly that wisdom is not a set of ideas; Wisdom is a person.  Solomon  has  repeatedly  tried  to  get  his  son  to  marry  Wisdom.  Here  in Proverbs 8 he makes another push by telling him why he should marry her. He details all of her amazing qualities (Kidner, Wisdom of Proverbs, 22-24).13 We  find  out  in  this  chapter  that  Wisdom  does  not  just  stand  for  Solomon's wisdom; it stands for God's Wisdom. In the fullness of time, Paul reveals to us that  Jesus  is  the  Wisdom  of  God  (1  Cor  1:24,30).

As you read the entirety of Proverbs 8, ask yourself the question: Who in the world can this be describing? Now, why should you marry this Wisdom? Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Tells You the Truth about Reality PROVERBS 8:1-11 Woman  Wisdom  is  a  personification  of  Solomon's  wise  teaching.  She  is presented  as  a  female  because  the  Hebrew  word  for  \"wisdom\"  is  a  feminine noun, and the audience of Solomon's teaching is a young man. But this passage reveals  more  to  us  than  the  previous  passages  have.  Wisdom  is  not  just  a personification of Solomon's wisdom; Wisdom is also a personification of God's Wisdom  that  he  used  to  create  the  universe.  Let's  see  how  this  text  describes God's Wisdom. Wisdom cries out in the public places where there are tons of people because she  wants  everyone  to  hear.  Wisdom  is  competing  against  rivals  (i.e.,  the immoral  woman  of  Proverbs  5-7  and  the  Woman  Folly  in  Proverbs  9)  for  the people's attention. Her activity is in broad daylight instead of at nightfall (7:9). Wisdom  stands  at  the  public  crossroads  (8:2)  where  a  decision  must  be  made (Fox, Proverbs 1-9, 265).14 Whom will you follow? Folly (cf. 9:13-18)? Wisdom? She wants everyone's attention and allegiance. She calls out to all of humanity, especially  the  inexperienced  and  the  fools.  She  will  teach  them  common  sense (8:5). She can make them wise-that's why they should listen. You should listen to Wisdom-Jesus-because he can make you wise. Listen  to  her  because  she  speaks  the  truth  and  tells  you  the  way  the  world really works (8:6-9). She tells you what is \"right\"-the difference between good and evil. Not only morality, but she tells you the order of the world, and she does not twist or pervert that order. That is what her teaching in the rest of the book is about. Hard work is better than laziness or get-rich-quick schemes. While it may seem  like  indulging  pleasure  will  gladden  you,  it  will  actually  sadden  you  (cf. 21:17).  Wisdom  tells  it  like  it  really  is,  whereas  Folly  twists  things.  Folly  tells you  what  you  want  to  hear  but  not  what  you  need  to  hear.  Take  the  short  cut, indulge pleasure, hoard your possessions, hold a grudge, and more. Wisdom  distinguishes  between  wickedness  and  righteousness  too.  She  does not distort the truth like Folly. You see, the fool may sincerely believe what he "}
{"Page": 89, "Info": "says  is  true,  but  he  cannot  see  how  he  misrepresents  truth  and  reality  because what he says is not true. One example of this is calling \"good\" something that God says is sin. Proverbs 24:24 talks about the one who says to the guilty, \"You are  innocent.\"  Justifying  sin  or  saying  it  is  not  sin  is  distortion  of  reality. Wisdom will not do that. She calls sin what it is. She will help you understand this, and she will produce this kind of truthful speech in you. You can avoid lies, gossip, and slander if you will follow Wisdom (i.e., Jesus). The perceptive person knows that Wisdom's words are right and that they will help  him  or  her  to  navigate  through  this  life,  so  they  submit  to  her  (8:9). Following Wisdom's instruction is better than riches because Wisdom is vastly superior  to  worldly  wealth  (vv.  10-11).  Nothing  you  desire  can  compare  with Wisdom.  Wisdom  is  the  pearl  of  great  price.  This  is  what  Proverbs  teaches. Money  can  be  a  good  thing  if  it  is  not  given  first  place  in  your  life.  After  all, Jesus says you cannot serve two masters (Matt 6:24). Wisdom will not tolerate rivals. So seek Wisdom first, and all these things will be added to you! Make a faith decision to get Wisdom-Jesus-and be satisfied in him above all else. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Produces Right Living in His Followers PROVERBS 8:12-16 Wisdom has associates that she will share with you: shrewdness, knowledge, and discretion. If you want these qualities, you have to know Wisdom. If you want these qualities, you have to go to Jesus. The ability to make right decisions, the ability to carefully consider a situation without making a snap judgment, and the ability  to  read  people  are  available  through  a  relationship  with  Jesus.  Wisdom teaches you how to navigate life in a way that avoids your ruining things. Wisdom  here  first  shows  you  who  to  associate  with,  and  then  she  tells  you whom  to  avoid.  The  fear  of  Yahweh,  which  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom,  is  to hate evil (v. 13). She hates pride, arrogance, the evil way, and perverted speech (we  saw  that  earlier  in  the  text).  She  despises  those  who  won't  humble themselves under authority and counsel. She will keep you off the wicked path if you embrace her. She will produce counsel, sound wisdom, insight, and strength in her followers (v. 14). Strength reveals that wisdom is not simply the ability to discern the right decision, but it's also the wherewithal to carry it out. Wisdom  is  the  means  by  which  kings  reign  and  decree  justice.  Wisdom  is needed to rule and establish the kingdom. Wisdom is how a king will order his "}
{"Page": 90, "Info": "kingdom.  Solomon  recognized  this  so  he  asked  for  wisdom  in  1  Kings  3. Wisdom is the skill to rule. This is promised of the coming Messiah in Isaiah 11. He will reorder the entire creation through wisdom. Jesus is the fulfillment. He is the  Messiah  who  patterns  his  kingdom  after  wisdom  (see  the  Sermon  on  the Mount in Matt 5-7). Those of us who follow Christ will also rule with him, so we need the wisdom of this book. We are in an internship for eternity right now. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Rewards His Followers PROVERBS 8:17-21 Wisdom says, \"I love those who love me, and those who search for me find me\" (v. 17; cf. Matt 7:7). So commit to the wisdom of Proverbs and commit to the Wisdom of Proverbs-the word and the Word (cf. John 1). In order for you to live out the word, you must first be in a personal relationship with Jesus. Getting Wisdom is most important, but there are blessings that will be added to  you  if  you  do.  The  rewards  of  wisdom  are  lasting  riches,  a  good  name,  and righteousness  (v.  18).  This  is  not  teaching  a  prosperity  gospel  because,  as Proverbs  has  already  shown  us,  the  rewards  may  not  come  immediately  in  a fallen  world.  But  there  will  be  eternal  blessings  for  getting  Wisdom-Jesus. Wisdom  says  that  what  she  produces  in  you-wisdom  and  righteousness-is better than money. It is better than money because she will lead you down the right path (i.e., obedience to the law), which means a greater reward later. She will  reward  you  with  an  inheritance  if  you  love  her,  and  she  will  fill  your treasuries  (v.  21).  Again,  these  kinds  of  physical  rewards  may  come  now, especially  the  rewards  of  a  good  reputation  and  walking  in  righteousness,  but they will surely come in the new creation. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Brings His Followers into Harmony with God, Others, and the World PROVERBS 8:22-31 This  section  is  rich  and  complicated.  We  see  a  heightening  of  Wisdom's description. Wisdom is presented here not just as Solomon's wisdom but rather as Yahweh's Wisdom. Wisdom is the only begotten child of God (v. 22). We see that  this  description  of  Wisdom  can  no  longer  be  seen  just  as  a  poetic  device. The description is too lofty, and it is too much like Jesus. After all, Revelation 3:14  calls  Jesus  \"the  originator  of  God's  creation\"  (Nestle,  Novum  Testamentum "}
{"Page": 91, "Info": "Graece,  788).15  This  doesn't  mean  that  Jesus  was  created;  it  means  that  he  is supreme over the creation. Wisdom  existed  before  the  creation  and  is  superior  to  the  creation.  Wisdom knows the created order because Wisdom was there, and Wisdom seems to have assisted in creating (vv. 22-30; cf. John 1; Col 1) (Goldsworthy,  Tree  of  Life, 79- 81).  Before  humanity  was  created  from  the  dust,  Wisdom  was  there.  The mention of the \"first soil\" (v. 26) reveals the fragility of humanity. If humanity lives contrary to the wise design of the creation, we will return to our prior state (i.e.,  from  dust  to  dust)  (Garrett,  Proverbs,  109).  Wisdom  knows  the  order  of things and can share that order with humanity because Wisdom assisted Yahweh in  creating  the  world.  Wisdom  builds  the  creation.  Wisdom  also  built  the tabernacle  (Exod  31)  and  the  temple  (1  Kgs  7),  which  are  patterned  after creation. The wise Messiah will rebuild the cosmos (Isa 11). Wisdom builds her house  in  Proverbs  9,  as  we  will  see.  Jesus  created  the  world  in  the  beginning, Jesus upholds the world now (Heb 1), and Jesus will make all things new at the end. So one must know him in order to perceive and live according to the pattern of the world. Because he made the world, he knows how it works. Wisdom  says  in  effect,  \"I  delighted  in  God,  his  world,  and  humanity.\" Wisdom  is  the  mediator  in  the  relationships  of  all  three:  (1)  between  man  and God,  (2)  between  man  and  man,  and  (3)  between  man  and  the  world.  Wisdom orders these three relationships as it was in Eden. So you must know Wisdom- Jesus-in  order  to  live  in  harmony  with  God,  with  other  people,  and  with  the world around you. There  is  a  design  in  the  way  that  the  world  works,  and  this  order  can  be observed by anyone who is looking (e.g., at the ant in Prov 6). If you try to live against the grain of this order, it will injure you. Adultery will cause you to lose much  of  what  you  have.  The  famous  golfer  Tiger  Woods  can  attest  to  this. Unchecked greed will lead to much debt. The American government can attest to this. Laziness will lead to inability to hold down a job and failure to provide for your family. There is a way that the world works. You see, it is not just that sin is wrong, although it is. Sin is also destructive. Our big problem is that even if we can observe how things work, we so often fail to apply the knowledge we gain. We need Jesus. He is the one who can give us harmony with God, which will lead to harmony in our relationships and safe passage through daily life in the world around us. That leads to the final reason to marry Wisdom. Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Gives Abundant and "}
{"Page": 92, "Info": "Marry Wisdom Because Jesus Gives Abundant and Eternal Life PROVERBS 8:32-36 Wisdom finishes her sermon by saying, \"Listen to me; those who keep my ways are  happy\"  (v.  32).  Following  Wisdom  is  the  path  to  blessing;  neglecting Wisdom  is  the  path  to  death  (v.  36).  Searching  for  and  finding  Wisdom  is  the path to life and a right relationship with God by grace (v. 35). This means that following  after  Wisdom-Jesus-is  the  path  to  a  good  life  now  and  an  eternal life later. And following after Folly will injure you now and cause you to perish later. Who can speak like this? Who can say, if you find me, you will receive life and  the  grace  of  God?  And  who  can  say,  if  you  fail  to  find  me,  you  will  die? Only Jesus could say these things. Jesus is saying you must choose. He's saying, choosing me or not choosing me is the difference between life and death. That's a massive claim, but then again Jesus is the Wisdom of God. The old Christmas carol \"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\" says of Jesus, Conclusion O come Thou Wisdom from on high, And order all things, far and nigh; To us the path of knowledge show, And cause us in her ways to go. (Henry Sloane Coffin) Christianity has confessed for a long time in song what Proverbs 8 has taught us. The Wisdom of God, who ordered the cosmos and can teach us the right path, took on flesh in Bethlehem ( John 1:14). If you want to be wise in daily life-if you want to know how the world works-then you must be in a relationship with him. If you're not walking in wisdom, it reveals an issue with Jesus in your life.

Accept the Invitation of Wisdom-Jesus-to Become Wise and Receive Life (9:1-6). II. How You Act Reveals Which Invitation You Have Accepted (9:7-12). III. Reject the Deadly Invitation of Folly-Idols (9:13-18). T hroughout  Proverbs,  two  women  have  been  competing  for  the  son's affections:  Lady  Wisdom  and  the  immoral  woman.  As  we  have  seen, Wisdom will make you wise and grant you life, and the immoral woman will kill you. Proverbs 9 is the climax to the introduction of the book. In this chapter, the immoral  woman  is  personified  as  Folly.  This  is  the  lynchpin  to  the  book  of Proverbs. This chapter sums up all that came before and sets up all that comes after.  It  all  comes  down  to  this:  Whom  will  you  love?  Whom  will  you  marry? It's a choice between being wise and being a fool-between life and death. The choice  you  make  will  determine  whether  you  walk  the  path  of  wisdom  or foolishness in life.16 There  are  two  competing  invitations  given  in  this  chapter.  There  is  an invitation from Wisdom ( Jesus) to a party, and there is an invitation from Folly (idols or Satan) to a party. Which will you accept? If you accept the invitation of Wisdom  (  Jesus),  you  will  be  made  wise  and  receive  true  life  forever.  On  the other hand, if you accept the invitation of Folly (idols or Satan), you will be a fool who wrecks his life and then perishes. This has huge implications for your life right now-for the nitty-gritty details of your life. If you want to live the wise life and receive eternal life, you must accept  Jesus's  invitation.  If  you  are  walking  in  wisdom  in  your  daily  life  right now, it shows that you have accepted Jesus's invitation. It reveals that you are walking toward him, walking with him, and trusting in him. On the other hand, if you're walking in foolishness, it shows that you are walking toward idols (Satan) and trusting in them. This is revealed in the seemingly mundane details of your life  according  to  Proverbs.  If  you  are  lazy,  quarrelsome,  cannot  accept correction, cannot pay the bills on time, or your kids run amok, it is because you "}
{"Page": 95, "Info": "are acting like an idolater! But if you work hard, can be trusted with secrets, and can correct your kids, then you are acting like a follower of Jesus. The bottom line is this: If you do not have a relationship with Jesus, you will not be wise because you cannot be wise. If you are not walking in wisdom right now, it shows a problem with Jesus in your life that you need to repent of. The time is now to make this decision because that choice determines whether or not you can follow the wisdom of Proverbs 10-31. Accept the Invitation of Wisdom-Jesus-to Become Wise and Receive Life PROVERBS 9:1-6 Wisdom built her house, and it is a temple because it's at the highest point of the city  (v.  3).  Perhaps  Solomon's  temple  had  \"seven  pillars\"  (cf.  1  Kgs  7:17) (Murphy  and  Huwiler,  Proverbs,  42).  As  we  have  seen,  Wisdom  is  a personification of Solomon's wisdom and God's Wisdom; and this poetic device points  to  Jesus,  so  it  is  natural  for  Wisdom  to  dwell  in  a  temple.  As  we  have seen,  Wisdom  built  creation  (Prov  3;  8),  the  tabernacle  (Exod  31),  and  the temple (1 Kgs 7). Wisdom here prepares a marriage feast of meat and wine. As in  Isaiah  55,  this  meal  is  free.  As  in  Isaiah  25,  this  meal  gives  life  (Prov  9:6). Through her maids, Wisdom invites everyone in the most public places to come to  the  party  (v.  3),  especially  those  who  lack  a  heart  and  need  a  new  one.  The phrase  translated  \"lacks  sense\"  in  verse  4  literally  says  \"lacks  a  heart.\"  The inexperienced are those who have not yet made a decision. Wisdom calls to them to turn in at her house, come to her party, eat her feast, and drink her wine. This is very similar to the parables in Matthew 22 and Luke 14, where the kingdom of God  is  compared  to  a  wedding  feast-a  banquet.  All  are  ultimately  invited  to this feast. The servants are sent out to the highways and hedges to invite all. This meal gives life, and those who refuse it will die. Wisdom is not just offering food and drink. Like Jesus, she is offering herself as food and drink that brings life (cf. John 6) (Leithart,  Blessed  Are  the  Hungry, 71- 74). Accepting this invitation entails repentance (i.e., turning from your simple ways),  receiving  life,  and  walking  in  the  way  of  understanding  (Prov  9:6).  In essence,  what  Wisdom  is  saying  is,  \"Repent  of  your  foolishness,  come  to  my party, marry me, and I will make you wise and give you an abundant and eternal life.  You  will  live  wisely  if  you  know  me.\"  So  recognize  that  you  are  a  fool, "}
{"Page": 96, "Info": "marry Wisdom, eat her food, and Wisdom-Jesus-will produce wisdom in you now and give you eternal life. How You Act Reveals Which Invitation You Have Accepted PROVERBS 9:7-12 There's  a  big  question  to  ask  about  Proverbs  9:7-12:  How  do  these  verses  fit, sandwiched  between  the  two  invitations  of  Wisdom  and  Folly?  The  answer  is that they are giving examples of Wisdom's teachings so that you know how to read  the  rest  of  Proverbs.  These  verses  seem  straightforward,  but  they  must  be read  in  this  context.  After  all,  these  verses  contrast  the  two  ways  (i.e.,  the  two invitations): wisdom and wickedness. These verses show what these two women teach and produce in their followers progressively. The party you choose to go to determines if you keep these. The party that you choose to go to determines how you  act  in  daily  life.  Whether  you  act  wickedly  or  wisely  reveals  which  party you  chose.  Belief  always  determines  behavior,  but  behavior  reveals  what  you believe. This is a worship issue. Here is the wise teaching. Do not correct a mocker (ESV, \"scoffer\") because you  will  just  get  hurt  in  the  process,  and  the  mocker  will  hate  you  (vv.  7-8). Correcting a mocker is a waste of time because he will not listen to you. It will have no effect on him. All you will receive are verbal attacks from him in return. You  will  be  humiliated.  There  are  some  who  will  never  listen  to  wise  counsel and  will  never  humbly  submit  to  authority.  On  the  other  hand,  you  should correct a wise man. He will love you for it, and he will become wiser (vv. 8-9). A wise man is humble enough to know he needs correction. So  according  to  these  verses,  wisdom  is  the  discernment  to  know  whom  to correct and whom not to correct. You do this by discerning the outcome. How will your correction be received? This is wisdom. Since Jesus is the Wisdom of God,  that  means  being  formed  into  Christlikeness  is  not  just  growing  in  a reduction  of  sinfulness,  although  that  is  part  of  it.  It  is  also  growth  in discernment. Being like Jesus means having the ability to see the situation you are in. It means recognizing when to correct people and when not to correct them because it will only make things worse. It also means knowing when not to play the coward and to speak up and say something in the right situation. There is also the implication in these verses that if you are the kind of person who cannot accept correction, you are a mocker. If you get angry when someone "}
{"Page": 97, "Info": "confronts you, you are a mocker. On the other hand, if you can humbly accept correction because you know you have not arrived, then you are wise, and you will love the person who had the courage to confront you. How do you respond to  confrontation?  Do  you  automatically  get  angry?  Or  do  you  listen  and  try  to see the truth in it? Do you have any relationship where someone has the freedom to ask you tough questions? Wisdom is the ability to hear and respond correctly to criticism so that you don't repeat the same mistakes. The  point  of  Proverbs  9  is  that  if  you  cannot  accept  a  rebuke,  it  is  not  just because  that  is  your  personality  type;  it  reveals  idolatry  in  your  life  (perhaps worship of self). This is true in all kinds of practical areas that Proverbs touches on.  If  you  are  stingy,  it  reveals  an  idolatry  of  money.  If  you  have  a  porn addiction,  it  reveals  an  idol  of  sex.  If  you  cannot  discipline  your  children,  it might reveal that you have made your kids an idol. The  starting  point  for  practical  wisdom  is  a  covenant  relationship  with Yahweh  (the  fear  of  the  Lord;  v.  10).  You  cannot  be  wise  without  this relationship.  There  is  no  secular  and  sacred  divide  in  life.  Covenantal  faith  in Yahweh  will  lead  to  balancing  your  checkbook,  cleaning  your  room  at  your mom's  request,  enjoying  being  with  your  family  more  than  making  money.  If you  cannot  do  these  things,  it  is  not  just  a  character  flaw;  it  is  a  spiritual problem. This is the last time Wisdom talks. She urges you to pick wisdom, but it's your choice. If you pick her, it will lead to life (v. 11). She will produce wisdom in you and reward you with longer life. But you are responsible to make your own decision, and how you live reveals which invitation you accepted. Reject the Deadly Invitation of Folly-Idols PROVERBS 9:13-18 The  forbidden  woman  is  now  personified  as  Folly.  Woman  Folly  is  the  power behind  this  forbidden  woman.  Embracing  Woman  Folly  will  lead  to  the  same place as embracing the forbidden woman-the grave (5:5; 9:18). The forbidden woman epitomizes folly ( just like the noble wife epitomizes Woman Wisdom; ch. 31). This Woman Folly is a counterfeit who copies but perverts everything Wisdom does. Folly's house is a temple too because it is at the highest point of the  city  (9:14).  This  is  how  we  know  that  Folly  stands  for  idols  (Longman, Proverbs, 222). Turning away from Wisdom was characterized as unfaithfulness to God  (1:32).  One  is  unfaithful  to  God  when  one  is  whoring  after  idols.  That's exactly what's happening here. "}
{"Page": 98, "Info": "Woman  Folly  is  loud,  seductive,  ignorant,  and  lazy  (9:13-14).  She  will produce this in her followers. She invites everyone to her party (vv. 15-16). She calls out to the same crowd as Wisdom-those who lack heart. She says to turn in at her house, come to her party. Her meal is illicit. Her water is stolen, and her bread  is  to  be  eaten  in  secret.  This  may  seem  \"tasty\"  (v.  17),  but  the  way  that seems right will not end well. Picking up on Proverbs 5:15, where water refers to sex, this seems to be an invitation to an affair. She's not just offering food and drink;  she's  offering  herself  as  food  and  drink.  She's  offering  an  illicit relationship  that  will  lead  to  apostasy,  to  walking  away  from  God.  Solomon knows  that  sexual  sin  leads  to  abandoning  God.  We  see  that  she  seduces  her victims by giving them half-truths. Yes, this affair will bring temporary pleasure, but  she  does  not  reveal  the  death  that  awaits  them  (v.  18).  That's  what foolishness is. Foolishness is not seeing the connection between your actions and their consequences. Like a cow walking into a slaughterhouse, you don't know that  you're  about  to  become  filet  mignon.  Her  guests  do  not  realize  that accepting her invitation is accepting an invitation to their own funeral. They go into the grave (v. 18; \"depths of Sheol\"). There may be a destruction now like public  shame,  loss  of  family,  or  loss  of  money;  but  all  of  that  is  simply  a foretaste of what's to come-hell. "}
{"Page": 99, "Info": "Conclusion Proverbs 9 is the story of Wisdom sending out her servants to invite us to a meal -a party-that brings life instead of death. Proverbs says that those who eat this meal will be made wise. The New Testament says that Jesus is the Wisdom of God,  and  he  invites  us  to  a  meal  as  well.  He  invites  us  to  feast  on  him.  Those who eat this meal-those who feast on Christ's flesh and blood-will live and be a part of his kingdom. Christ's meal is not for those who think they're wise; it is  for  those  who  know  they  are  fools  and  who  want  to  grow  in  wisdom.  Have you accepted Christ's invitation? Jesus  lived  a  perfectly  wise  life,  yet  he  took  the  punishment  our  foolishness deserved. He went into Sheol-the grave-and came back in victory three days later. He invites you to accept forgiveness from him. If you do, he will transform you into a wise person. The choice is yours! If you are an unbeliever, recognize the  foolishness  in  your  life,  repent  for  the  first  time,  and  come  to  Jesus  for salvation. If you are a believer, ask the Lord to reveal your foolishness to you, then confess it to him, repent of it, run to Jesus, and ask to be made like him. "}
{"Page": 101, "Info": "How to Read Proverbs PROVERBS 10:1-32 Main Idea: Jesus will produce the wisdom of Proverbs in your life progressively. I. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Work and Money (10:2-5). II. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Words and Mouth (10:8). III. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Relationships (10:1,12). IV. Jesus Produces Wisdom That Leads to Rewards in Your Life and the Life to Come (10:24-32). P roverbs 10 starts a new section in Proverbs. This is what we think of today when  we  think  about  Proverbs:  the  one-or  two-line  sayings  of  earthy wisdom  in  Proverbs  10-31.  We  will  look  at  this  chapter  to  learn  how  to  read Proverbs. We cannot cover all of it, but we want to answer the question, How do you read Proverbs? How do you understand the book? For  those  of  you  who  know  something  about  the  book  of  Proverbs  or  who have read it or have several verses memorized, that may seem like a strange task. That may seem like a weird question: How do I rightly read Proverbs? We might understand that question if it were asked about Romans or Isaiah or Leviticus but not  with  Proverbs,  because  it  is  pretty  simple  and  straightforward  for  the  most part. It gives practical advice. I may not understand sacrificing a goat and what to do with the entrails in Leviticus, but I understand when the Bible tells me to not be lazy or to discipline my children. Those are easy to comprehend. For the most part we would say that the majority of the Proverbs are easy to understand. Here is the problem-there is a right way and a wrong way to read the book of Proverbs.  There  is  a  right  way  to  read  Proverbs  that  leads  to  joy  and  life,  and there is a wrong way to read Proverbs that leads to misery or pride. Here's the difference-you  can  read  the  Proverbs  like  a  Pharisee  and  say,  \"I  need  to  do these things in order for God to love me. I need to obey these practical bits of advice because if I do them, God will accept me.\" That is one way to read the book  of  Proverbs-and  that  is  the  wrong  way!  We  should  not  read  it  like  a Pharisee.  Instead,  we  need  to  read  the  Proverbs  like  blood-bought  Christians who  say,  \"These  are  not  the  things  that  we  do  in  order  to  get  God  to  love  us; these are the things that we do because God already loves us. We do not do these "}
{"Page": 102, "Info": "things  to  become  his  children;  we  do  these  things  because  in  Jesus  Christ  we have  already  been  adopted  into  his  family,  and  now  here  is  how  we  live  our lives.\"  There  is  a  huge  difference  between  those  two  approaches.  Reading  the Bible like Pharisees will lead you into either misery when you fail or pride when you feel like you succeed. But if you read it like a Christian, it will lead you to become wise and joyful. The  behaviors  that  we  read  about  here-most  of  Proverbs  10-31  does  talk about  conduct-are  not  things  that  God  tells  you  to  do  in  order  to  become  his child. They are not things God tells you to do in order for him to love you. These behaviors are what the Lord is producing in those who are already his children- those  who  are  already  a  part  of  his  family.  He  is  slowly,  progressively conforming you to the image of Christ; he is making you more like Jesus Christ, who is the Wisdom of God. Proverbs is very much a book on sanctification. If  you  say,  \"I  don't  have  these  things  in  my  life.  My  life  is  a  wreck,\"  then maybe  the  reason  you  do  not  have  them  is  because  you  are  not  a  believer  in Jesus. I hope Proverbs 10 will reveal to you the areas of your life where you are a fool and sinful, and then will drive you to Jesus Christ as your Savior. Then, through faith in Christ, the wisdom of Proverbs is what God will produce in your life  daily.  The  gospel  is  not  about  making  yourself  righteous;  it  is  not  about doing  these  things  to  become  righteous.  The  gospel  is  about  how  the righteousness of Jesus has been credited to your account by virtue of your faith in him and how, by his Spirit and by his Word, he is molding you and shaping you to become more like him. It's a slow process. It is gradual. You can take two steps forward, one step or three steps back, then a few steps forward again. But it is a process whereby God is molding you and shaping you into the image of his Wisdom, who is Jesus Christ. The Christian life is lived by faith. You live by faith recognizing your sin and foolishness, and then you daily repent of the areas where you are not believing the gospel or worshiping Jesus rightly. As you do that, the Lord shapes you into the image of Christ so that you can live out the wisdom of Proverbs. We are not saved by faith plus works, but we are saved by a faith that does work. Faith will produce obedience and wisdom in your life. Proverbs 9 teaches us this truth. Proverbs teaches that when we fail to live up to  God's  wisdom  it  is  evidence  of  idols  in  our  hearts  that  we  are  worshiping rather than Jesus. It reveals a problem with Jesus in our lives. Proverbs 9 was the key  chapter-the  hinge  chapter-because  it  summed  up  everything  that  came before it (Prov 1-8) and it sets up everything that comes after it (Prov 10-31). "}
{"Page": 103, "Info": "The  whole  point  of  Proverbs  9  was  that  you  have  two  beings  that  vie  for  your affection,  love,  and  worship  (Longman,  Proverbs,  58-61,  64-68).17  One  is  the Wisdom of God ( Jesus) and the other is Folly, who represents idols. Solomon tells his son that if you want to be wise, you need to have a personal relationship with  Wisdom  (  Jesus);  and  if  you  want  to  be  a  fool,  you  will  choose  a relationship with idols. And the choice is a matter of life and death. The choice you make determines whether or not you can walk the path of wisdom in your daily life. The choice determines whether or not you can follow the wise advice given  here  in  chapters  10-31.  To  walk  the  wise  path  and  obey  this  practical advice that he gives to his son, one must have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  You  can  be  smart,  you  can  have  a  high  IQ,  and  you  can  be  very intellectual; but without a relationship with Jesus you cannot be wise. No matter how smart or wise you may be in the eyes of the world, without a relationship with Jesus you cannot walk in wisdom as it is laid out in the book of Proverbs. The interpretation of Proverbs 9 is critical for us to understand as we head into this  new  section  in  Proverbs  10.  The  heading  \"Solomon's  proverbs\"  in  10:1 indicates  the  start  of  a  new  section.  It  is  different  from  what  has  come  before. The second part of the book-the proverbs proper-is what we typically think of when  we  think  about  Proverbs.  These  are  the  short,  pithy,  sometimes  random sayings of practical wisdom rather than extended discourses.18 Whether or not you are walking in wisdom daily-which means all kinds of things from whether or not you listen to your parents when they tell you to do something,  whether  you  can  finish  an  assignment  on  time,  or  whether  you  can control  your  tongue-reveals  whether  you  are  worshiping  Jesus  or  worshiping idols.  Whether  you  walk  in  wisdom  or  foolishness  reveals  whether  you  are  in right relationship with Jesus or you are an idolater. If you see patterns of foolishness in your life with finances or relationships or a hundred other things, it reveals that you are worshiping someone or something other  than  Jesus.  It  could  be  multiple  idols,  and  Proverbs  does  not  necessarily spell out what the specific ones are. In a lot of places the main idol that leads us into foolishness is ourselves! When we exalt ourselves and put ourselves number one in our own lives, that will lead to all kinds of foolishness. Self is the idol at the  root  of  so  much  foolishness  in  Proverbs,  like  not  listening  to  anyone  else when they give you advice or try to correct you because you think you know so much more than everyone else. For others, money is the idol at the root of their foolishness,  which  manifests  itself  as  greed,  covetousness,  or  trying  get-rich- quick schemes. For others, comfort is their idol, so they are lazy. "}
{"Page": 104, "Info": "For  others,  their  children  are  their  idols,  so  they  put  their  children  up  on  a pedestal  and  refuse  to  discipline  them.  They  act  like  their  children  are  little deities  they  have  to  appease  at  all  costs  so  that  they  will  not  get  mad  at  them. That  is  what  idolatry  looks  like.  In  impoverished  countries,  people  think  they have to give food or money to the idol at the temple so the idol will not unleash evil spirits on them. That is the kind of worship we see every time a child pitches a  temper  tantrum  in  the  toy  aisle  at  Target  and  their  parents  give  them  the  toy they want! When we worship something or someone other than Jesus, it leads to all sorts of practical foolishness in our lives. The  practicalities  of  life  laid  out  in  Proverbs  10-31  reveal  our  worship  life. Worship is not just about singing on Sunday. The Bible says that you should do everything, whether you eat or drink or whatever it is, to the glory of God (1 Cor 10:31).  That  is  what  Proverbs  is  about  if  you  want  to  boil  it  down-it  reveals where your life is idolatrous and where you are not believing the gospel. Proverbs  10-31  is  random  and  disconnected,  but  there  are  major  categories that you can look at thematically (as we will in this book). The major categories are  things  like  words,  work,  finances,  relationships,  and  future  rewards.  Since these things reveal whether we are in right relationship with Jesus or worshiping idols, what Proverbs shows us is that there is no spiritual and secular divide in life.  You  do  not  have  your  religious  life  over  here  and  your  secular  life  over there. Proverbs says all of the areas of your daily life are spiritual in nature. It does not matter how morally neutral the advice Solomon gives here may seem to be;  it  is  not  neutral.  These  practical  areas  of  your  life  either  show  you  are moving toward Jesus or you are moving away from Jesus. That has everything to do with whether or not you can clean your room, whether or not you have right relationships, and whether or not you can balance your checkbook. So we must read chapters 10-31 in this context. God  lays  out  for  us  through  Solomon  how  life  works  best.  Life  works  best when first you have harmony with God (i.e., you have been reconciled to him), which  leads  to  harmony  in  your  relationships  with  other  people  and  the  world around  you.  God  knows  this  because  he  is  the  one  who  made  the  world.  He knows the way the world works because he made it. He is good, he loves us, and he wants to share that key with us through the Spirit here in Proverbs. Often it seems  that  when  we  read  God's  counsel  and  advice,  we  think  to  ourselves,  \"I don't like that. That doesn't seem like it's going to make me happy. That seems like it might hurt me in the long run.\" What the Bible tells us instead is that the reason  God  tells  you  these  things  is  not  because  he  does  not  want  you  to  be "}
{"Page": 105, "Info": "happy.  He  tells  you  these  things  so  you  can  have  a  true  happiness  that  lasts forever. He loves you. He wants you to know the way life works best. He knows that a life filled with idols will destroy you and everyone around you. We will walk briefly through Proverbs 10 and some cross-reference verses in other  parts  of  Proverbs  to  see  examples  of  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs  so  we  can know how to read the whole book as a book about Jesus and our wisdom in him. Proverbs  10  mainly  contrasts  the  two  ways  or  paths  that  we  have  seen  so  far. There  is  a  way  of  wisdom  and  a  way  of  foolishness.  There  is  a  way  of (synonymous  with  wisdom)  and  a  way  of  wickedness righteousness  (synonymous  with  foolishness)  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  447).19  Solomon constantly contrasts these two paths in these major categories of life. We will see how that is laid out here and see that Proverbs 10-31 points us to how Jesus will produce this kind of wisdom progressively in his followers. What  we  see  differently  starting  in  chapter  10  is  how  random  everything  is now.  Let  me  talk  to  you  about  being  a  wise  son,  then  let's  talk  about  money, then let's talk about laziness, then let's talk about the blessing of the Lord, then let's  talk  about  how  you  use  your  mouth,  and  then  let's  talk  about  how  you discipline  your  children.  It  is  all  over  the  place  and  scattershot.  We  should  not think this is by accident. The reason it is random is because the book of Proverbs is  Solomon  obeying  the  command  to  parents  in  Deuteronomy  6  to  teach  their children the law.20 God gave very specific commands to the parents about how to teach their children the law. He said you do it when they wake up, when they sit, when they walk along the road, and when they lie down. How much of your day is given to waking up, sitting, walking around, and lying down? The entire day!  That  is  the  point.  He  is  saying  that  your  task  as  a  parent  is  to  teach  your children the law throughout the day. How does that work? For those of you who are parents, do you sit children down one day and say, \"OK. Let me map out our week.  Monday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  marriage and  dating  and  romance  (most  of  you  probably  do  not  have  a  lot  of  material here).  Tuesday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  work. Wednesday,  I  will  teach  you  everything  you  need  to  know  about  how  to communicate.\" And so on. Is that the way we teach our children? Do you just sit them down and pour every bit of information you have into them? Of course not. Instead, we may talk about a hundred different things as we go through the day. We will talk to them about things from the mundane to the sublime, like how to throw  a  baseball,  how  to  drive  a  car,  how  to  do  a  job  interview,  how  to  spend money  wisely,  how  to  handle  a  conflict  with  a  friend,  how  to  handle  dating "}
{"Page": 106, "Info": "issues, how to improve their prayer life-all kinds of things. We go through our day,  and  as  conversations  and  topics  come  up,  we  have  the  responsibility  to teach our children. That is what's happening in Proverbs.

There are some broad categories that we can use to arrange things in a sermon so  that  it  is  easier  for  us  to  walk  through  them.  In  fact,  in  the  rest  of  this commentary there will be different thematic series that will tackle all of these in more detail; but in this message we want to get a glimpse of what Proverbs says about these different areas of life so that we can understand how to read the book rightly in its entirety. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Work and Money PROVERBS 10:2-5 Jesus produces wisdom in your life in the way you work and handle money. We see these themes early on in this section in Proverbs 10:2-5 that deal with money and  our  work  ethic.  Solomon  writes  in  verse  2,  \"Ill-gotten  gains  do  not  profit anyone, but righteousness rescues from death.\" If you are a greedy person, if you are a person who cheats the government, or if you are a person who cheats your employer, then that will not profit you like you think it will. You are an idolater. Sometimes idolatry is not worship of bad things. It can be the worship of good things that you have put in the place of God. Proverbs says many things about money. Proverbs can be very positive. It says that  if  you  are  a  wise  person,  you  will  make  more  money,  generally  speaking. But  the  Proverbs  are  not  always  positive  about  money.  They  do  not  say  that every time you accumulate money you should take it as a sign of God's blessing in  your  life.21  Money-if  it  is  not  gotten  in  the  right  way  or  if  you  trust  in  it (11:28)-is destructive. I had a friend who in college worked for a company that would sell things to senior adults that senior adults really did not need. After a couple of weeks, the person felt extremely guilty for selling things to people that they did not need and talking them into spending money they did not have. Yet, the employer was pressuring for more and more sales. My friend considered the people  on  these  sales  calls  and  thought,  \"I'm  swindling  my  grandmother.\"  My friend quit the job. The Bible says that these wrong ways of getting money are "}
{"Page": 107, "Info": "destructive  and  harmful  to  you.  Other  examples  where  we  can  see  this  are  the Enron debacle and Ponzi schemes. But  the  problem  that  many  of  us  have  with  this  text  is  the  question,  Is  this really true? The reason we have that problem is because we have observed in our lives people who have cheated the system and gotten away with it. They made tons  of  money  and  had  financial  security  even  though  they  went  about  it  the wrong way. So are these proverbs true? Is this really the way the world works? Proverbs 10:3 says that the Lord will not let the righteous go hungry. What about Christians in the Sudan who are starving to death? What about Christians in your church who lost their jobs and now their families are struggling? Does that mean they are not God's children or that God does not love them? The key to understanding the Proverbs is that we must view them in light of Christ  and  eternity.  Do  not  view  them  in  terms  of  immediacy.  Generally  these things  are  true  immediately,  but  they  will  always  be  true  ultimately  (Dever,  The Message,  510).  The  wicked  may  make  more  money  now  and  the  righteous  may starve right now, but in the end those who are outside of Christ will have trouble and those who are in Christ will be trouble free. Those in Christ will be enriched, and  those  outside  of  Christ  will  lose  all  that  they  have.  How  can  you  come  to know this for certain? Look to the life of Jesus.22 Judas-who gets money in the wrong way-ends up dead; but the righteous one, Jesus, is delivered from death, just like verse 2 promised! Jesus is the only one who is righteous. If you are in him, you will be rescued from death later and freed from love of money in the present. Proverbs 10:4-5 turns to the issue of work ethic when it says, Idle hands make one poor, but diligent hands bring riches. The son who gathers during summer is prudent; the son who sleeps during harvest is disgraceful. Solomon  says  two  things:  laziness  will  lead  to  poverty  and  shaming  your parents,  while  diligence  and  hard  work  lead  to  riches  where  you  are  able  to provide  and  bring  joy  to  your  parents.  Again,  wisdom  is  about  the  effect  your actions  have  on  you  and  the  people  around  you.  The  problem  is  that  hardly anyone confesses that they are a lazy person. No one has ever walked into my office  for  counseling  and  said,  \"I'm  really  wrestling  with  laziness.\"  No  one thinks  they  are  lazy  because  the  picture  of  laziness  in  their  mind  is  the  couch potato who watches soap operas all day long while eating Klondike bars in their bathrobe. In Proverbs, laziness refers to people who cannot see their assignments through to completion (see Moore, \"Finding Jesus\"). They might start a task and get to the middle of it, but they walk away before it is finished. It's the son who "}
{"Page": 108, "Info": "helped  plant  the  crops  but  is  not  there  during  harvest  to  finish  the  task.  In  our day, the laziness of Proverbs looks like distractions that keep you from staying on task. You cannot complete your assignments because Facebook distracts you for thirty minutes. You come back and do five minutes of work, but then check Twitter for fifteen minutes. Laziness is seen in the extended adolescence of our culture where kids can't grow up and provide for themselves but keep ending up back  at  Mom  and  Dad's  house  (bringing  shame  to  their  parents,  even  if  the parents  won't  admit  it).  Laziness  keeps  you  from  providing  for  your  family  or from the ability to have a family, and the failure to provide for your family is a failure to believe the gospel-it's a Jesus problem (cf. 1 Tim 5:8). We see these same themes throughout the Proverbs. Proverbs 13:11 says in the ESV,  \"Wealth  gained  hastily  will  dwindle,  but  whoever  gathers  little  by  little will increase it.\" Murphy and Huwiler prefer that translation as well and writes, \"The  sense  is  that  when  money  comes  too  easily  for  a  person,  it  will  not  last\" (Proverbs,  65).  Proverbs  consistently  condemns  get-rich-quick  schemes  as disastrous.  We  can  sit  back  and  observe  that  this  is  truly  the  case.  How  many stories  have  you  heard  of  NFL  or  NBA  stars  who  made  millions  and  were bankrupt  before  they  hit  forty?  For  many,  they  gained  all  that  money  too quickly, without having formed the kind of wisdom that was necessary for them to know how to handle and steward that money well. That is true for us as well. We have to be shaped and molded with the kind of character it takes to be able to handle money rightly. That kind of wisdom typically comes by gaining money little by little. Jesus works in your life so that he who is faithful with a few things can now be given many things. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Words and Mouth PROVERBS 10:8 Jesus grows you in wisdom when it comes to the use of your tongue. We see this theme again and again in Proverbs 10. For example, verse 8 says, \"A wise heart accepts commands, but foolish lips will be destroyed.\" The ESV uses the phrase \"babbling fool\" at the end of the verse, which Waltke seems to prefer when he writes, The fool is so full of himself that instead of having the capacity to accept wisdom he dangerously prattles out his own \u2018clever opinions,' which are devoid of true wisdom. (Proverbs, Chapters 1-15, 459) "}
{"Page": 109, "Info": "Here is the point, and this is a major theme in Proverbs: If you are the kind of person  who  loves  to  hear  the  sound  of  your  own  voice  and  who  speaks  more than  you  listen,  then  you're  probably  a  fool.  You  are  probably  worshiping  the idol of self. How  many  of  you  know  people  who,  when  you  have  a  conversation  with them,  they  look  like  they  are  not  listening  to  a  word  you  are  saying  at  all  but rather are just waiting for you to take a breath so they can speak? They want to tell you their thoughts on things, but they do not want to hear your thoughts at all. Maybe you are that kind of person. If you are the kind of person who loves to talk and cannot receive commands or advice from others, then you are a fool and  it  will  end  up  hurting  you.  You  will  come  to  ruin.  Why?  Because  if  you cannot listen to someone else's instructions, you will never learn from your own mistakes. All  of  us  think  that  we  are  right.  Obviously,  I  think  my  views  are  right  on everything!  Otherwise  I  would  change  to  a  different  view.  If  I  thought  I  was wrong, why would I keep holding on to the wrong view? So I think that all of my views on everything are right, but I know in my heart that my views could not possibly all be right. I just can't figure out which ones are right and which ones are  wrong. But if  you are the kind of person who loves  to talk and never listen to others with the awareness that you may be wrong, then you will never grow  as  a  person  and  you  will  continually  make  the  same  mistakes.  You  can't learn where your views, decisions, and choices are off unless you are willing to receive  commands  and  counsel  from  others.  Wisdom  is  being  able  to  receive advice humbly and follow it. This has everything to do with Jesus, who perfectly accepted the commands of his Father and knew when and how to speak rightly. We  see  this  theme  throughout  Proverbs.  Proverbs  13:3  says,  \"The  one  who guards  his  mouth  protects  his  life;  the  one  who  opens  his  lips  invites  his  own ruin.\" Proverbs repeatedly says that those who speak a lot also sin a lot and are destructive to themselves and the people around them. Since we are sinners, the more  we  talk,  sooner  or  later  something  stupid  will  come  out  of  our  mouths. How  many  times  have  you  said  something  and  immediately  wished  you  could take it back? But you can't! Jesus produces the ability to guard your tongue. Jesus Produces Wisdom in the Area of Your Relationships PROVERBS 10:1,12 "}
{"Page": 110, "Info": "Wisdom has to do with relationships. Whether you are the kind of person who loves your neighbor or makes fun of your neighbor reveals whether you are wise or  a  fool  (11:12).  Whether  you  are  the  kind  of  person  who  can  keep  secrets reveals whether you are wise or a fool (11:13). Are you the kind of person who is  told  something  in  confidence,  then  a  few  days  later  you  confide  in  another friend, \"Hey, I'm only telling you this and you can't tell anyone else, but did you know  that  .  .  .\"?  If  you  do  that,  you  are  an  idolatrous  fool.  Most  likely  the inability to keep secrets reveals that you worship yourself because you like to be the person who has and disseminates information. That has everything to do with your relationship with Jesus. Wisdom  has  to  do  with  all  kinds  of  relationships.  Whether  or  not  you  are generous  to  the  poor  (11:24),  take  care  of  your  animals  (12:10),  listen  to  your parents  (13:1),  keep  good  company  (13:20),  or  date  the  right  people  reveals whether or not you are wise and walking with Jesus. Jesus doesn't just reconcile you to God; he reconciles you to others (Eph 2:14). We see an example of this here at the start of Proverbs 10. Verse 1 states, \"A wise  son  brings  joy  to  his  father,  but  a  foolish  son,  heartache  to  his  mother.\" Those are parallel lines that complement each other. Do not misread the text so that you think it means that the mom will not be happy if her son is wise, or that the dad will not be heartbroken if his son is a fool. No, it is a parallelism with the father in the first line and the mother in the second line. The basic idea is that if you are a wise child, you will make your parents happy, but if you are foolish, you will break your parents' hearts. The whole principle that Solomon teaches is that  your  wisdom  or  foolishness  has  emotional  consequences  for  the  people around  you,  specifically  your  parents.  You  need  to  observe  the  response  that your  behavior  elicits  from  your  parents  to  know  whether  you  are  wise  and  in right relationship with Jesus or whether you are a fool who is walking away from Jesus.23 Wisdom has everything to do with the emotional results you bring out of your  parents.  If  you  bring  your  parents  shame  because  of  foolish  decisions, words,  or  actions,  you  have  a  problem  with  Jesus.  If  you  choose  friends  who corrupt you, if you choose dating relationships that are harmful for you, or if you get involved with peers in drugs and alcohol and break your parents' hearts, that reveals  idolatry  in  your  life.  Plenty  of  parents  feel  this  heartache  because  of decisions their children have made. This  reality  has  everything  to  do  with  your  relationship  with  Jesus.  I  (  Jon) think that all of us would have to admit that we have made decisions that hurt our parents. I'm not exempt from that. The good news of the gospel is that this "}
{"Page": 111, "Info": "convicting  reality  points  us  to  Jesus.  Jesus  is  the  one  who  perfectly  fulfills  the wisdom  of  Proverbs.  Jesus  was  the  one  who  was  perfectly  wise  and  perfectly honored  his  parents.  That  is  why  Luke  2:51  points  out  that  Jesus  submitted  in everything to Mary and Joseph. That is why in John's Gospel when Jesus hangs on the cross suffocating to death, he makes provisions for his mom to be taken care  of  after  he  dies  (  John  19:26-27).  Why  did  Jesus  do  that?  Jesus  did  that because he perfectly honored his parents. The truth of the gospel is not only that Jesus  kept  the  fifth  commandment  for  us  but  also  that  Jesus  died  the  death  we deserved  to  die  for  shaming  our  parents.  He  offers  us  his  perfect  record  of righteousness and wisdom through faith. He offers to wipe our slate clean of all the times we dishonored our parents. Through the Spirit, Jesus makes us the kind of children who bring joy to our parents. Relationships  are  again  addressed  in  Proverbs  10:12,  \"Hatred  stirs  up conflicts, but love covers all offenses.\" Hatred, anger, and a violent temper are not  good  conflict-resolution  techniques.  That  seems  simple,  but  we  all  need  to hear  it.  Again,  the  root  of  this  is  idolatry,  most  likely  worship  of  self  that prevents you from letting go of a perceived wrong against you. What is a good conflict-resolution technique? Love! Seeking the best in others, not just seeking the best in yourself. Giving the benefit of the doubt to others, not just giving the benefit  of  the  doubt  to  yourself.  Forgiving  other  people,  not  just  overlooking your own sin while you fixate on others' sins. If you are constantly angry, if you are the kind of person who loves a good fight, and if you are continually stirring up conflict, you are a fool. The way that you resolve conflict in wisdom is this: \"A  gentle  answer  turns  away  anger\"  (15:1).  You  resolve  conflicts  by  loving others and letting go of the offenses (see Eph 4:32). Again we see this fulfilled in Jesus.  Jesus-by  his  love  on  the  cross-covers  our  offenses  against  God  and reconciles us to God. Not only does he resolve the conflict between us and God, but that vertical reconciliation should also lead to horizontal reconciliation where we  love  and  forgive  others  around  us.  Being  a  blood-bought,  wise  Christian means that you see the way God dealt with you and your sin and your offense against him, and then you deal that way with others who wrong you: You love them! You forgive them! Jesus Produces Wisdom That Leads to Rewards in Your Life and the Life to Come PROVERBS 10:24-32 "}
{"Page": 112, "Info": "Following  Jesus  leads  to  rewards  in  this  life  and  in  the  one  to  come.  Proverbs 10-31 really boils down to conduct and the consequences that come out of that conduct.  Solomon  is  a  good  teacher.  Solomon  doesn't  just  tell  his  son  what  to do, he tells him why he should do it. Here is what will happen. If you are wise, here is the good that can result. But if you are foolish in your life, here is the bad and the harm that could come out of it. He teaches his son using both the what and the why. These themes come up  repeatedly in Proverbs 10  as well. Verses 24-32  deal with the rewards and consequences of wisdom and foolishness. It is a matter of life and death. Verse 24 states, \"What the wicked dreads will come to him, but what  the  righteous  desire  will  be  given  to  them.\"  What  do  you  fear?  What  are your  nightmares?  Do  you  fear  financial  ruin?  Marital  ruin?  Do  you  fear  your children  not  turning  out  the  way  that  you  want  them  to?  Do  you  fear  not succeeding at your job? Do you fear not having a good reputation? Do you fear death and the judgment of hell? Solomon says that if you are a fool-outside of Christ-those are the things you will receive. What you fear is exactly what will happen to you. But if you are wise and righteous through Christ, which means your desires have now been transformed to be God's desires for you, then you will get what you desire! Whether that desire is eternal life, a strong marriage, a godly family, or whatever God is molding you and shaping you to desire, those are  the  things  you  will  receive.  Those  rewards  may  come  now  in  this  life,  but they will certainly come in the life to come because verse 25 says the righteous will be established \"forever.\" Throughout Proverbs 10 and following, these consequences are presented both as  present  and  future.  Proverbs  12:21  promises  stability  in  your  life  and  not chaos when you walk in wisdom, whereas 12:28 promises that the righteous will never die. The problem is, none of us are righteous; so this verse means hell for us. But in Christ we are counted righteous; and even though we might die, yet we  will  live  forever.  Faith  in  Jesus  leads  to  life  eternal  beginning  the  moment you put your trust in him. "}
{"Page": 113, "Info": "Conclusion Often when I ( Jon) read Proverbs, it can be very discouraging because when I read these things and take stock of my life, I think about how often I've messed up.  I  think  about  how  often  I  did  not  listen  to  my  parents.  I  think  about  how often decisions that I made brought sadness to my parents instead of happiness. I think  of  how  often  I've  said  things  to  people  that  were  harmful  and  hurtful.  I think  of  how  often  I  did  not  listen  to  some  bit  of  advice  that  I  needed  to  hear, that  someone  told  me  because  they  loved  me.  I  think  of  how  often  I  shared secrets that I should've kept. I think of how often I procrastinated on tasks that were  assigned  to  me.  I  think  of  how  often  I  didn't  forgive  somebody  who wronged  me.  In  all  of  these  things  that  Proverbs  lays  out,  I  see  how  I  have messed up repeatedly. But  here  is  how  we  read  these  things  in  Proverbs  rightly,  and  in  a  way  that brings  joy  and  not  discouragement.  It  is  summed  up  in  the  words  of  Graeme Goldsworthy on the book of Proverbs: Jesus has fulfilled in our place the perfection God demands. He was the truly wise and fully sanctified human on our behalf. Thus, as we struggle to become wise, we know that our failures do not disqualify us from life because Christ himself is our only qualification. He, when all is said and done, is our wisdom, and to possess Christ is to be accounted wise by the only judge who matters. (Tree of Life, 98) "}

For a nickel you can buy an ice cream cone with sprinkles; buy a soft drink (called a soda pop); make a phone call in a telephone booth; or buy enough stamps to mail a letter and two postcards. Gasoline is eleven cents. Grass is something you mow not smoke. Coke is a soft drink not an illegal drug. Pot is something you cook in. AIDS are helpers not a disease. School shootings and metal detectors are not even science fiction. Yes, the world certainly has changed, and we can expect even greater changes in  the  very  near  future.  We  are  smarter  and  wealthier  people,  but  a  nagging question continually haunts us: Are we wiser? Have we really learned anything? Are we ready for what lies ahead? Are we ready to meet our God? Every generation has the potential for good or evil, to live wisely or play the fool. It is hard to be optimistic when you take an honest look at our world today. Several  years  ago  an  outrageous  rock  star  named  Marilyn  Manson  commented just  one  week  after  the  massacre  at  Columbine  High  School,  \"I  try  to  show people that everything is a lie-pick the lie you like best . . . and I hope mine is the best\" (Veith, \"Youth Anti-culture\"). Perhaps  we  could  adjust  the  Bible  a  bit,  as  we  too  often  want  to  do,  and describe the modern mindset this way: \"Father, forgive us, for we know not what we are doing-and please don't tell us. We won't listen!\" We too easily buy into lies. We too readily play the fool. We can easily see this foolishness in someone like Marilyn Manson, but we often do not see it in ourselves. We disobey God's Word  because  we  think  that  our  lives,  our  marriages,  our  money,  or  our parenting  situations  are  the  exception  to  God's  clear  teaching.  When  we  think that, we show we would rather live a lie-like a fool-than live the truth. Proverbs  continually  contrasts  the  way  of  the  wise  with  the  way  of  the  fool. Proverbs 18:1-9 continues that pattern with \"a description of the fool's antisocial nature,  activity,  and  consequences\"  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31,  68).  Waltke "}

In particular, what does he teach him concerning  a  fool's  antisocial  behavior  (vv.  1-3),  his  words  (vv.  4-8),  and  his work ethic (v. 9)? "}
{"Page": 118, "Info": "A Fool Lacks Wisdom PROVERBS 18:1-3 A fool in Proverbs is a person who lacks wisdom. He is a person who \"does not delight in understanding\" (v. 2). He is not able to see life from God's perspective and act accordingly. He is oblivious to the ways of God and refuses the counsel of true friends. Three aspects of his lack of wisdom are noted in verses 1-3. He Isolates Himself (18:1) A fool is a person who isolates himself from others. He is antisocial and a loner who  is  absorbed  with  himself.  His  interests  are  located  in  his  own  desires,  his own self-gratification. Further, because he is self-centered, he does not listen to the \"sound wisdom\" of others. When those who love him try to reason with him, \"he breaks out\" (ESV), \"he starts a quarrel\" (NIV), \"he rebels\" (CSB). The fool is a loudmouth who only causes trouble because he never listens to anyone. He is quick tempered, rages emotionally out of control, and refuses to receive godly wisdom.  The  Message  paraphrases  verse  1  this  way:  \"Loners  who  care  only  for themselves  spit  on  the  common  good.\"  Proverbs  11:14  reminds  us,  \"Without guidance, a people will fall, but with many counselors there is deliverance.\" A wise  person  will  surround  himself  with  good  and  godly  friends  who  love  him enough  to  tell  him  the  truth-even  when  it  hurts.  He  will  not  play  the  Lone Ranger. After all, even the Lone Ranger needed Tonto! He Is Opinionated (18:2) Verse  2  informs  us,  \"A  fool  does  not  delight  [ESV,  \"takes  no  pleasure\"]  in understanding, but only wants to show off his opinions.\" The fool has a closed mind but an open mouth, a small mind and a big mouth. He does not listen, but he is quick to tell others what he thinks. Pride is alive and well in his soul. He is convinced  that  what  he  thinks  is  what  everyone  else  ought  to  think.  He  is  too clever and cute for his own good. God gave us two ears and one mouth; perhaps we would all be wise to listen twice as much as we talk. James 1:19 provides a very  wise  word  of  counsel  at  this  point:  \"Understand  this:  Everyone  should  be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger.\" He Will Be Humiliated (18:3) Because a fool keeps to himself, will not listen, and loves to hear the sound of his  own  voice,  he  will  eventually  humiliate  himself.  In  this  instance  his foolishness  leads  him  into  wickedness.  Because  his  character  is  flawed, "}
{"Page": 119, "Info": "wickedness characterizes his life. He is not a wise person but a foolish person. He is not a good  person but \"a wicked  person.\" His foolish choices eventually cost  him,  and  they  cost  him  big  time.  Three  words  describe  the  fool's humiliation:  contempt,  dishonor,  and  disgrace  or  derision.  Derek  Kidner  calls these three \"sin's traveling companions\" (Proverbs, 127). Robert Alden notes, Sin belongs with shame as dishonor goes with disgrace. The series starts with sin which leads to shame (or contempt). Shame is just a step away from dishonor which leads to disgrace. . . . Sin is a road which progresses downward; the consequences of walking it are progressively more severe. (Proverbs, 138) A Fool Is Loose with His Words PROVERBS 18:4-8 When  you  go  to  the  doctor  for  your  check-up  he  or  she  always  looks  at  your tongue  because  it  is  an  indicator  of  your  physical  health.  God  says  that  you should listen to what flows from your tongue because it is an indicator of your spiritual  health.  Unfortunately,  apart  from  salvation  in  Jesus,  who  redeems  the total  person,  the  tongue  runs  wild  and  spews  all  sorts  of  poison  and  venom. James 3:8 says, \"No one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.\" Proverbs repeatedly speaks to the importance and power of the tongue, and it does so again in 18:4-8. Here the focus is specifically on the words that come bubbling out of the mouth of the fool. He Does Not See the Delight of His Words (18:4) This verse contrasts the words of the fool with the words of the wise. The idea is that the words of a wise man are a continuous supply of blessing and nourishing counsel  (Ross,  \"Proverbs,\"  1023).  Deep  waters  are  cool,  pure,  and  refreshing. They bless and do not curse. They build up; they do not tear down. They are like a  beautiful \"flowing  river\"  or a \"fountain of wisdom.\" A  contrast is implied: a fool's  words  are  stale,  possibly  bitter,  potentially  poisonous.  They  cater  to  the wicked (v. 5), stir up strife (v. 6), ruin lives (v. 7), and find a home with those who gossip (v. 8). There is no delight to be seen in the fool's words. He Does Not See the Disgrace of His Words (18:5) Verse 5 places us in the context of the courtroom. The fool shows \"partiality to the  guilty  by  perverting  the  justice  due  the  innocent.\"  He  takes  the  side  of  the wicked (through his testimony?) against the righteous. Perhaps he thinks the evil "}
{"Page": 120, "Info": "person can help him out and further his agenda while the innocent person cannot. His  actions  and  words  turn  truth  upside  down  and  betray  the  innocent.  We cannot  help  but  immediately  think  of  Jesus  and  the  false  witnesses  who  sided with the wicked and powerful Sanhedrin against the innocent and sinless Son of God (Mark 14:55-59). The fool forgets or ignores the wisdom of Proverbs 19:5: \"A  false  witness  will  not  go  unpunished,  and  one  who  utters  lies  will  not escape.\" He Does Not See the Danger in His Words (18:6) \"The 10 Commandments of Human Relations\" are attributed to Robert G. Lee, pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis, Tennessee, 1927-60: 1.  Speak  to  people.  There  is  nothing  as  nice  as  a  cheerful  word  of greeting. 2.  Smile  at  people.  It  takes  seventy-two  muscles  to  frown,  only  four  to smile. 3.  Call people by name. The sweetest music to anyone's ear is the sound of one's own name. 4.  Be friendly and helpful. If you would have friends, be friendly. 5.  Be  genuinely  interested  in  people.  You  can  like  almost  everybody,  if you  try.  (If  you  cannot  like  them,  you  can  still  love  them  through Jesus.) 6.  Be generous with praise-and cautious with criticism. 7.  Be considerate with feelings of others. There are usually three sides to a controversy: yours, the other person's, and the right one. 8.  Be  alert  to  give  service.  What  counts  most  in  life  is  what  we  do  for others. 9.  Learn to trust people. That trust builds relationships. 10.  Have a sense of humor. If you add to the above a good sense of humor, a  big  dose  of  patience,  and  a  dash  of  humility,  you  will  be  rewarded manifold. As you might expect, a fool values none of this wise counsel. Actually a fool, as verse 6 teaches, is really good at talking himself into trouble. \"A fool's lips lead to strife, and his mouth provokes a beating.\" The ESV says, \"A fool's lips walk into  a  fight,  and  his  mouth  invites  a  beating.\"  The  Message  paraphrases  it  quite colorfully:  \"The  words  of  a  fool  start  fights;  do  him  a  favor  and  gag  him\"  (cf. "}
{"Page": 121, "Info": "19:29). A fool's words push people over the edge, and he is the one who pays the price with a tail-whipping! He Does Not See the Destruction in His Words (18:7) Verse  7  repeats  the  idea  of  verse  6,  but  it  advances  the  argument.  The  fool receives  a  beating  in  verse  6,  but  he  is  destroyed  in  verse  7  (Waltke,  Proverbs, Chapters  1-15,  73).  Solomon  tells  us,  \"A  fool's  mouth  is  his  devastation  [ESV, \"ruin\"; NIV, \"undoing\"], and his lips are a trap for his life.\" Words are powerful weapons,  and  sometimes  we  use  them  to  our  own  ruin  and  destruction.  The picture is of a man who lays a deadly trap and he does so for himself! And he does this with his own lips, his own words. The fool is the man who cannot keep his  mouth  shut  even  though  his  words  will  ruin  him;  they  will  wreck  his  life. There is a self-destructive nature to the words of a fool as he reaps what he has sown  (Gal  6:6-7).  Proverbs  10:14  reinforces  the  truth  of  his  verse:  \"The  wise store  up  knowledge,  but  the  mouth  of  the  fool  hastens  destruction.\"  Proverbs 12:13  adds,  \"By  rebellious  speech  an  evil  person  is  trapped,  but  a  righteous person escapes from trouble.\" A wise man will never forget that a lifetime of building a good reputation can come  crashing  down  and  be  destroyed  with  one  careless  word.  He  will  also remember a very simple axiom: if I don't say it, I won't have to apologize for it. There are far more regrets in life for what we did say (tweet, post on Facebook) than there are for what we did not say. Jesus reminds us in Matthew 12:36-37, I tell you that on the day of judgment people will have to account for every careless word they speak. For by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned. He Does Not See the Disease in His Words (18:8) Proverbs 18:8 and 26:22 are identical. They address the wicked and destructive sin of gossip. People love to gossip. It is virtually a universal human addiction. We just cannot get enough. Like a man strung out on heroin or crack cocaine, we just have to have more. Solomon helps us understand why this sin-and it is sin -is  so  powerful.  He  tells  us  that  gossip  is  like  \"choice  food  [ESV,  \"delicious morsels\"] that goes down to one's innermost being.\" The GNT says, \"Gossip is so tasty-how we love to swallow it!\" Going into the innermost being, the words become a part of who we are. And they always \"stimulate the desire for more\" (Ross,  \"Proverbs,\"  1025).  Waltke  says  they  are  \"a  delectable  contagion  and  so more  dangerous\"  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  73).  Proverbs  16:28  says,  \"A contrary person spreads conflict, and a gossip separates close friends.\" Proverbs "}
{"Page": 122, "Info": "26:20 adds, \"Without wood, fire goes out; without a gossip, conflict dies down.\" Ray Ortlund summarizes the matter of gossip well: Let's all admit it. We love gossip. We love negative information about other people. We love controversy. We find it delicious. It is a delicacy-to our corrupt hearts. We gulp these words down with relish. But the contagion goes down into us and makes a deep impression and leaves us even sicker than we were before. Truly, God is not mocked. He then goes on to raise some very good questions and, in the process, he puts every one of us on the spot! Ortlund asks, Do you speak up when others are put down? Or do you just stand there and listen in sinful silence as the blast of gossip and slander hits you in the face? God says, \"Open your mouth.\" With every unkind word that goes unconfronted a reputation dies. So much is at stake in our words. They matter not just to us but even more, far more, to God. We are always speaking before the face of God. (Proverbs, 134) A Fool Is Lazy concerning Work PROVERBS 18:9 Verse  9  concludes  this  section  with  a  quick  and  simple  word  about  our  work ethic. Walt Disney said success is \"doing something so well that people will pay to  see  you  do  it  again.\"  President  Theodore  Roosevelt  said,  \"Far  and  away  the best  prize  that  life  offers  is  the  chance  to  work  hard  at  work  worth  doing\" (\"Address to the New York State Agricultural Association\"). Unfortunately the Proverbs  fool  is  completely  out  of  touch  with  these  kinds  of  perspectives. Shoddy workmanship and a poor work ethic is no problem for the fool. He has no problem being a slacker. He Is Poor in His Performance A fool is lazy in doing his job, or \"slack in his work\" (ESV). He is content to do just enough to get by. A poor job performance review is of no concern as long as he keeps his job. He is not known as a hard worker and he does not care. He is not known as an honest worker and he does not care. He is not known as the guy who  gives  110  percent  and  he  does  not  care.  He  is  not  known  as  the  guy  who will go the extra mile and he does not care. Colossians 3:23-24 calls the devoted follower  of  King  Jesus  to  a  different  and  higher  mindset  when  it  comes  to  our work. There Paul writes, "}
{"Page": 123, "Info": "Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not for people, knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord. You serve the Lord Christ. He Keeps Company with Destructive Partners The fool is a slacker and \"is brother to a vandal.\" Laziness and slothfulness are destructive.  Laziness  and  destruction  are  twins,  two  peas  in  a  pod,  bedfellows. They  are  related  to  one  another,  similar  in  nature.  Ross  says,  \"The  one  who  is slack  may  look  for  shortcuts,  and  may  make  things  that  fall  apart.  His destruction  may  be  indirect  and  slow  in  coming,  but  it  is  just  as  problematic\" (\"Proverbs,\"  1025).  Do  you  cut  corners  at  work?  Then  you  are  a  fool.  Do  you take  shortcuts  to  save  time  and  energy?  Then  you  are  a  fool.  You  are  selling yourself  short,  neglecting  the  gifts  and  abilities  God  has  given  you,  cheating others, and potentially putting people at great risk. So I don't tighten the bolt on the  car  wheel.  What's  the  big  deal?!  When  you  realize  that  you  are  always working  for  a  King  who  knows  your  name  and  sees  everything  that  you  do,  it will make a difference in how hard you work and in the quality of your work. He gave his best for you. Does he not deserve the same from you? "}
{"Page": 124, "Info": "Conclusion Jesus Christ is the quintessential Proverbs man, the embodiment of the Wisdom of God (1 Cor 1:30). He is also the antithesis of the fool in 18:1-9. The fool lacks wisdom, but Jesus is full of grace and truth ( John 1:14). Jesus was not isolated but surrounded himself with friends and companions with whom he shared life. He  was  not  opinionated  but  spoke  words  of  truth,  healing,  and  grace.  As  John 7:46  says,  \"No  man  ever  spoke  like  this!\"  It  must  be  admitted  that  he  was humiliated,  but  his  humiliation  was  for  the  benefit  of  others  as  \"he  humbled himself  by  becoming  obedient  to  the  point  of  death-even  death  on  a  cross\" (Phil  2:8).  He  was  dishonored  and  disgraced  so  that  we  would  not  have  to  be. And slack in his work? Not a chance. Not a hint. John 4:34 nails it: \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.\" Praise God, Jesus did finish the work the Father gave him and declared it to be so in John 19:30 when he said, \"It is finished.\" The Wisdom of God, the Lord Jesus, makes it possible for us to walk in wisdom and to not play the fool. His invitation is to all. How you will respond is up to you. "}

{"Page": 127, "Info": "The Sovereignty of God PROVERBS 16:1-15 Main Idea: Submit to the sovereign rule of God and his Messiah. I. God Is in Complete Control (16:1-3). II. God Will Sovereignly Judge Evil (16:4-5). III. God Sovereignly Saves and Rewards Sinners Who Submit to Him (16:6- 9). IV. God Sovereignly Rules the World through the Messiah (16:10-15). S ometimes  the  Word  of  God  is  difficult  to  swallow.  The  Bible  is  clear  that God  is  supremely  sovereign  and  in  control  of  all  things.  He  knows everything  before  it  happens.  He  declares  the  end  from  the  beginning  (Isa 46:10).  Nothing  surprises  him.  But  God's  sovereignty  means  more  than  that. God does whatever he wants (Ps 115:3). Whatever God wants to happen is what will happen. These things are not difficult to understand, but they can be really difficult to accept. They can really challenge our faith. The concept of God's sovereignty makes us uncomfortable because \"I've got free  will,  and  God  can't  infringe  on  my  choices,  otherwise  it's  not  free  will.\" Well, yes, you do have free will, and no, you really don't. There is no such thing as absolute free will. There are two biblical reasons we understand that our free will is not absolute, that we cannot do anything we want to do. First, your will is constrained by your nature. You can only make choices in accordance with your nature. For example, I'm free to dunk a basketball, but I ( Jon) cannot because I lack  the  ability  in  my  nature.  Since  you  are  a  sinner  by  nature,  you  cannot choose not to sin. It is inevitable that you will sin, regardless of how much you might not want to sin. While we might have the natural ability to make certain choices, our sin nature constricts us morally from actually doing it. Second,  the  Bible  teaches  that  God  can  and  does  override  human  free  will when he so desires. Proverbs 21:1 says, \"A king's heart is like channeled water in  the  LORD's  hand:  he  directs  it  wherever  he  chooses.\"  God  looks  at  a  human king and says, I can turn you whichever direction I want to turn you. We see an example  of  this  in  Genesis  20  when  Abraham  goes  to  Gerar,  where  King Abimelech reigns. As Abraham was prone to do, he lied about his wife Sarai and "}
{"Page": 128, "Info": "said she was his sister. He was fearful that the men of that region would try to kill  him  and  take  beautiful  Sarai  as  their  wife.  King  Abimelech  likes  what  he sees, and so he takes Sarai to be part of his harem of wives. But God comes to Abimelech in a dream and says he is a dead man because he is about to commit adultery with another man's wife. Abimelech objects that he did not know that. And God says this: \"Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience. I have also  kept  you  from  sinning  against  me.  Therefore  I  have  not  let  you  touch  her\"  (Gen  20:6; emphasis  mine).  Abimelech  certainly  wanted  to  touch  her,  but  God  would  not allow him. God can override the will of a human king, and he certainly can do that  with  us.  God  can prevent  you  from  doing certain  things.  He  can keep  you from sinning. God  is  supremely  sovereign:  he  ordains  everything  that  happens  (without being the author of evil; see Jas 1:13). Everything that happens in the world or in your  life,  he  either  causes  it  or  permits  it.  While  this  concept  makes  many uncomfortable, it is actually really, really good news. God's sovereignty means that  he  can  use  evil  acts  to  accomplish  his  good  purposes.  God  can  turn  the suffering  in  our  lives  into  something  really  good  for  his  glory  and  our  good (Rom 8:28). For example, Joseph was cruelly mistreated by his brothers and sold into slavery, but God used all of that suffering to save the people of Egypt and the members of Jacob's family. So Joseph told his brothers, \"You planned evil against  me;  God  planned  it  for  good  to  bring  about  the  present  result-the survival  of  many  people\"  (Gen  50:20).  God  is  sovereign  because  he  can  take rebellious acts meant for evil and use them to bring about his good plan. Nothing will thwart or frustrate or prevent his will and plan for the world or for your life as a Christian (Eph 1:11). Therefore, the miseries in our lives are never the final word because we serve a sovereign God. This is the greatest news in the world. We see Solomon lay this out clearly in Proverbs 16:1-15. "}
{"Page": 129, "Info": "God Is in Complete Control PROVERBS 16:1-3 Proverbs  16:1-15  is  one  of  those  rare  texts  in  Proverbs  10-31  that  is  a  unit, where Solomon is making a sustained argument, rather than a random collection of  verses  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  5-6).  The  passage  is  a  unified  whole because  thematically  it  speaks  of  God's  sovereignty,  man's  responsibility,  and God's sovereign rule on earth through the Messiah, symbolized here by a \"king.\" And we know it is a unity because of key catchwords: detestable (both in reference to Yahweh and the Messiah; vv. 5,12),  wicked (those who come against Yahweh and  the  Messiah;  vv.  4,12),  and  atone  or  appease  (vv.  6,14).  These  words  link verses  1-9  about  Yahweh  with  verses  10-15  about  the  Messiah.  God  exercises his sovereign rule on earth through the Messiah. God is sovereign over every aspect of our lives, including our free actions and choices. He is sovereign over the areas we think we control. Proverbs 16:1 says, \"The reflections [or the plans] of the heart belong to mankind, but the answer of the tongue is from the LORD.\" That means we make plans, but God's will is what determines  if  they  succeed,  not  our  ingenuity  (Murphy  and  Hurwiler,  Proverbs, 79).  Yes,  we  are  responsible  to  plan  and  make  wise  decisions,  but  God  is  the final determiner of whether they succeed or fail. Verse 3 says this reality should cause humble dependence on him: \"Commit your activities [ESV, \"work\"] to the LORD,  and  your  plans  will  be  established.\"  God's  sovereignty  is  meant  to diminish our pride, so the right response is to lean on him. These verses do not discourage  planning  or  decision-making  at  all,  but  they  do  make  us  humbly aware  of  God's  role  in  the  final  outcome  (Longman,  Proverbs,  328).  The  result belongs  to  God,  not  to  you.  So  we  don't  say,  \"Look  what  I  did,\"  but  rather, \"Look what God did.\" God is the one who oversees all of this. Verse  2  says  that  God's  sovereignty  extends  to  judgment:  \"All  a  person's ways  seem  right  to  him,  but  the  LORD  weighs  motives.\"  God  is  the  sovereign judge  because  he  judges  rightly.  He  judges  motives,  not  just  actions.  We  all think  we  are  right.  As  sinful  human  beings,  we  have  a  tendency  to  deceive ourselves  about  our  own  goodness  (Longman,  Proverbs,  328).  If  judgment belonged to us, we would certainly find ourselves innocent. But that is because we  are  judging  ourselves  against  our  own  standard  and  because  we  typically want to see the good in ourselves. We are much harsher judges of other people than we are of ourselves. We are also masters of justifying and rationalizing our sin  so  that  we  are  at  peace  with  it.  We  say,  \"I  know  I  shouldn't  have  lost  my "}
{"Page": 130, "Info": "temper, but what they did to me was really awful.\" Or, \"I know I have troubling controlling my tongue, but there's this guy at work who swears like a sailor. At least  I'm  better  than  him.\"  We  measure  ourselves  against  our  own,  wrong standard that is far beneath God's standard. That is a big problem for us because God judges us against his righteous standard. And he even knows the secrets of our hearts (1 Cor 4:4-5). We might put on masks with other people, but nothing is hidden from him, not even our motives and thoughts. He even knows the times that  you  do  a  good  thing  but  do  it  for  your  own  selfish  gain.  That  is  a  scary thought! Our response should be to commit our work to him (16:3). Submit to him in all things. Waltke connects the first three verses and says, Since the Lord assumes ownership of the disciple's initiatives (v. 1) and he alone can evaluate the purity of the motives behind them (v. 2), the disciple should commit his planned deeds to the Lord (v. 3a) to establish them permanently, outlasting the wicked person's temporary triumphs (v. 3b). (Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 11) Now let's be clear. We are not to be determinists. We are not fatalists. That is a pagan concept. We make real choices. We are free and responsible to make wise decisions.  Divine  sovereignty  and  human  responsibility  go  together  and somehow work together. The Bible says to embrace both of them. There are two wrong assumptions that we often make. First, we think for us to be truly free, God cannot be completely sovereign. Second, we conclude for God to be truly sovereign, we have to be robots. Both of those assumptions are dead wrong. The Bible teaches both that God is in complete control and that we make real choices that really matter and for which we are accountable. These verses mean you should not go about doing your own work and making your own plans and then pray and ask God to make them successful (Longman, Proverbs,  328).  Rather,  you  pray  beforehand  and  allow  God's  Word  to  be  the supreme guide  as  you  make your plans.  Then you work hard to do your  work, submitting all of it to the Lord. Do not be paralyzed in fear forever. Act. Plan. Work. Trust. Depend. Submit. Recognize that even if your plans do not work out as you had hoped, God can use what happened for a deeper, better plan in your life that you may not see. Live in peace, recognizing that God is in control and you  can  sleep  at  night.  We  really  misunderstand  the  Bible  if  the  doctrine  of God's sovereignty makes us scared and uncomfortable. It is meant to be a soft pillow  at  night.  God  has  got  this!  You  are  not  in  control  of  your  life,  so  stop "}
{"Page": 131, "Info": "fretting like you are. After all, as we sang in VBS, \"He's got the whole world in his hands.\" "}
{"Page": 132, "Info": "God Will Sovereignly Judge Evil PROVERBS 16:4-5 Proverbs  16:4  is  one  of  those  verses  that  grates  us.  It  reads,  \"The  LORD  has prepared everything for his purpose-even the wicked for the day of disaster.\" God  brings  everything  to  his  desired  end  and  goal,  even  the  wicked  for judgment.  There  are  two  possible  ways  to  interpret  the  last  line  of  that  verse. Either it means that God has created the wicked for destruction or that even the punishment  of  the  wicked  is  part  of  his  plan.  Whichever  option  you  take,  the Bible is clear that God is not the author of evil. It seems to best fit the flow of the passage if we interpret this verse as meaning that God uses human rebellion for his good purposes (as Longman argues, Proverbs, 329). Again,  this  truth  is  good  news  because  it  means  that  nothing  escapes  God, including wickedness. There is no exception. Even though it may look like the wicked are getting away with it, verse 5 assures us that the prideful who do not submit  to  God  will  not  go  unpunished.  They  will  not  escape  judgment.  It  is certain  that  there  will  be  an  ultimate  reckoning  and  a  final  accountability.  The wicked will not get away with it in the end. The text is not concerned with the how  or  the  when;  it  is  just  concerned  with  the  certainty  of  it.  That  is  both frightening,  since  we  are  sinners,  and  comforting,  since  all  of  us  have  thought from time to time, \"Why doesn't God do something about the evil and injustice in the world?\" He will! Also, these verses teach that people's wickedness does not frustrate or thwart the  plan  of  God.  That's  also  good  news!  He  actually  uses  their  evil  to accomplish his plan. No one can stop God's plan from coming to fruition. God can  even  use  the  wickedness  of  evil  men  crucifying  the  Son  of  God  to sovereignly accomplish his purpose of saving the world. God's sovereignty is good news because it means that evil and suffering won't last forever. Evil and suffering won't win in the end; God does. If you ever find yourself uncomfortable or questioning the notion of God's supreme sovereignty, ask yourself the question, \"Do I really want to live in a world where God is not supreme and in control?\" If God is not in complete control, how can we be sure that what Revelation 21 says about a day with no more tears will actually come about? If he is not sovereign, we cannot be certain that he will conquer evil and stop suffering. Without the sovereignty of God, there is no way to say that there will be no more tears, sickness, pain, sorrow, or death. God Sovereignly Saves and Rewards Sinners Who "}
{"Page": 133, "Info": "God Sovereignly Saves and Rewards Sinners Who Submit to Him PROVERBS 16:6-9 God  must  pour  out  his  wrath  on  sin,  but  he  also  makes  atonement  for  sin.  All evil breaks his heart and must be judged, but he graciously judges human sin at the  cross  so  we  can  escape  hell.  Proverbs  16:6  says,  \"Iniquity  is  atoned  for  by loyalty and faithfulness, and one turns from evil by the fear of the LORD.\" All sin is evil and an affront to God, but God graciously turns his wrath away from our sin  by  the  blood  of  a  substitute  in  our  place.  In  the  Old  Testament,  atonement was  made  by  the  blood  of  an  animal,  but  all  of  the  animal  blood  of  the  old covenant  points  to  the  final  sacrifice  of  Christ  on  the  cross  for  the  sins  of  the world. He is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world ( John 1:29). Proverbs 16:6 indicates that atonement reveals God's covenant love-his loyalty and faithfulness-toward us (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 80). We know that atonement leads to being made more like Jesus because the end of verse 6, after atonement has been made, references the fear of the Lord and turning  away  from  evil.  After  you  are  saved  by  the  atonement,  you  are  then made wise and holy through fear of the Lord-dependence on him. Verse 7 says that  salvation  includes  the  defeat  of  your  enemies.  In  the  new  covenant  our enemies  are  not  flesh  and  blood  but  rather  sin,  Satan,  and  death.  Jesus  has defeated them all in his death and resurrection, and we get to share in that. God's sovereignty is good news because it means that he saves us from our sin, makes us wise (see Rom 8:28-29), and defeats our enemies. The cross of Christ clearly reveals the supreme sovereignty of God. The cross is the ultimate example of God using evil to accomplish his good plan. Acts 2:23 states,  \"Though  [Jesus]  was  delivered  up  according  to  God's  determined  plan and foreknowledge, you used lawless people to nail him to a cross and kill him.\" The  cross  was  God's  plan,  but  lawless  people  hung  Jesus  there  because  they wanted  him  dead.  Acts  2  holds  both  man's  responsibility  and  God's  sovereign plan together. Acts 4:27-28 says, For, in fact, in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together against your holy Servant Jesus, whom you anointed, to do whatever your hand and your will had predestined to take place. God  predestined  the  cross,  but  men  freely  and  wickedly  chose  to  kill  Jesus. These work together. Pontius Pilate, Herod, the Jews, and the Romans were not kicking  and  screaming  with  their  hands  tied  behind  their  backs  saying,  \"We "}
{"Page": 134, "Info": "don't want Jesus to die, but we are being forced to do this.\" God used the wicked choices of man to bring about his glorious, sovereign plan. God's sovereignty is good news because it means he can take evil and use it for good. His sovereignty means that the suffering and chaos in your life is not meaningless or ultimate. You may not see how in the world what is happening to you could ever be a good thing, and you may never understand it until eternity, but you can trust that a God who did not remain distant from your suffering-but rather entered into your world, suffered even beyond what you are suffering, and died in your place-has a good reason and plan for why he is allowing all these things  to  happen  in  your  life.  Plus,  one  day  he  will  do  away  with  evil  and suffering forever. Revelation 21-22 is on the way! God  makes  sure  that  things  work  out  in  the  end.  Proverbs  16:8  is  the  only verse in 16:1-9 that does not mention God. We think there is a reason for that. We  take  Waltke's  argument  that  the  absence  is  intentional  because  he  seems absent  in  a  \"morally  upside-down  world\"  (Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31,  16).  It  says, \"Better a little with righteousness than great income with injustice.\" It is better to be poor and righteous than to be rich having gotten your money in a sinful way. This verse is a qualification. Generally in Proverbs the righteous get rich and the wicked  become  poor,  but  Solomon  says  it  doesn't  always  work  out  that  way. There  will  be  times  when  the  wicked  become  enriched  because  of  their wickedness, and there are times when the righteous will be poor because of their righteousness. In those times, you will be tempted to think God is absent and not involved, but he is still working all things together for his good purposes. There may be a season where it looks like evil is winning and things are not working out the way they should. But even though it may seem that God is not there, he is working and superintending the process. Evil can succeed temporarily and the righteous can suffer, but in the end God turns the tables. Proverbs 16:9 ends this section on God's sovereignty by saying, \"A person's heart plans his way, but the LORD determines his steps.\" Verse 9 caps Solomon's argument with a final statement on God's ultimate sovereignty. We make plans, but God orders our steps. He ordains all things. God Sovereignly Rules the World through the Messiah PROVERBS 16:10-15 "}
{"Page": 135, "Info": "Proverbs  16:10-15  gives  the  picture  of  the  ideal,  messianic  king  who  rules  as God's  vice-regent  on  earth  (see  Waltke's  great  discussion  on  this  in  Proverbs, Chapters  15-31,  16-22).  The  word  \"king\"  is  prominent,  appearing  in  every  verse but verse 11 ( just as God appeared in every verse in 1-9 except 8). These verses are  deliberately  paired  with  the  sovereignty  of  God  in  verses  1-9  to  show  that Messiah's reign mirrors the sovereign reign of God. In the Old Testament, God's sovereignty is mediated to the people through the human king. Let's walk through this description and see God's rule through the Messiah.  Verse  10  says  that  God's  verdict  is  on  the  king's  lips  so  that  he  can make infallible judgments. When the king judges, he judges rightly. He does not do anything that is unjust. When he judges, he literally speaks for God. So the Davidic king reigns and judges on earth in God's stead, upholding and executing justice. This is ultimately fulfilled in Jesus (see Acts 2:25-36). Proverbs  16:11  gives  an  example  of  Yahweh's  justice,  which  is  mediated through  the  king,  when  it  talks  about  honest  scales.  This  advises  against  an unethical business practice where sellers would cheat the buyer by changing up the  weight  system,  perhaps  by  having  heavy  counterweights  for  buying  and lighter ones for selling (Deut 25:13). Solomon says that God oversees that and is concerned about people not being cheated. The way God oversees it on earth is through the human king. The messianic king will make sure there is equity in his kingdom.  The  church,  as  an  outpost  of  the  kingdom,  should  model  fairness, equity, and righteousness to the world. Verse 12 shows how and why the king must uphold justice. Similarly to verse 11,  it  indicates  that  wicked  behavior  is  detestable  to  any  king.  Those  who practice wickedness-like the  merchants with unfair weights-are  abhorrent  to the king ( just like the wicked of v. 5 are repulsive to Yahweh). It is detestable to the  king  because  his  dynasty-his  throne-will  only  last  if  he  reigns  in righteousness  and  justice.  This  is  the  point  of  Proverbs.  Solomon  attempts  to train  his  son  to  be  the  ideal  king  who  sets  up  the  messianic  kingdom  by righteousness. Solomon wants to be a Deuteronomy 6 parent who trains his son in the law so that his son can become a Deuteronomy 17 king who is a man of the law. The problem is Solomon and all of his descendants fail, and this leads to the hope in Israel for a king who embodies the wisdom of Proverbs (Isa 11:1-5) and  who  can  finally  establish  the  eternal,  Davidic  kingdom.  This  is  fulfilled  in the Messiah Jesus.24 Jesus sets up a kingdom where there is no wickedness or injustice.  He  establishes  his  eternal  kingdom  in  righteousness  by  judging  the wicked. Goldsworthy notes this as well: "}
{"Page": 136, "Info": "Jesus comes as the only king of Israel to rule perfectly according to the ideals of kingship set out in Deuteronomy 17:14-20. He is the true son of David, thus fitting that role in a way that sinful Solomon could never do. (Tree of Life, 125) Since the kingdom is established in righteousness, kings are pleased with those who speak rightly (Prov 16:13). The author here encapsulates all of the activities of  the  kingdom:  work,  actions,  and  speech.  The  king  is  to  govern  all  of  these actions  to  establish  the  kingdom.  He  does  this  by  carrying  out  judgment, including capital punishment (v. 14). The wise person appeases the king because his  favor  is  like  a  new  creation  blessing  (v.  15).  Thus,  the  king-fulfilled  in Messiah Jesus-is to be judge and punisher. Life and death are in his hands just like  they  are  in  Yahweh's  hands.  The  king  wields  life  and  death  on  Yahweh's behalf. Jesus is both Savior and Judge, so we should bow the knee to him. We  see  this  same  picture  of  Yahweh  ruling  on  earth  through  his  Messiah  in Psalm  2.  This  rule  includes  wrath  against  those  who  stand  against  the  Messiah and Yahweh. The wise person kisses the Son so that he does not become angry (Ps  2:12).  As  in  Proverbs  16:15,  blessed  are  all  those  who  take  refuge  in  the Messiah! Conclusion Our response to the sovereign Lord and his Messiah is to bow the knee. Why? We bow to the King because God's sovereign plan for the world is centered on the Messiah. God's sovereign plan is to exalt the Son and through him to redeem persons from every people group on earth (see Rev 5; 7). God's plan will not be stopped,  so  do  not  take  a  stand  against  it.  Rather,  embrace  it.  It  is  foolish  to attempt to live outside the sovereignty of God. Submit to the King! Anyone who repents of sin and believes in Jesus will be saved and be part of God's plan for the  world.  For  some  of  you  this  may  be  scary,  or  you  might  have  a  hard  time agreeing with it, but deep in your heart you believe this and are comforted by it. After  all,  we  sing  about  this  all  the  time:  \"He's  got  the  whole  world  in  his hands,\"  and  \"From  life's  first  cry  to  final  breath,  Jesus  commands  my  destiny. No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man, can ever pluck me from His hand\" (Getty and Townend, \"In Christ Alone\"). That is good news! "}

This Verse Has Produced a Lot of Guilt in Parents. II. This Verse Is a Warning to Correct Your Children. III. This Verse Tells Us Our Children's Greatest Need Is the Good News about Jesus. few years ago a young lady very close to our family \"came out\" as a lesbian. A When  that  happened  her  parents,  who  are  faithful  Christians,  questioned their parenting, saying, \"Where did WE go wrong?\" They felt responsible for her decision as if it were their fault. Many Christian parents feel a crushing guilt when their children do not \"turn out right.\" They ask questions like, \"What did we do wrong? What else could we have  done?\"  What  is  more  problematic  is  that  the  guilt  so  many  Christian parents  feel  finds  its  root  in  the  Bible.  After  all,  Proverbs  22:6  states,  \"Start  a youth out on his way; even when he grows old he will not depart from it.\" This Verse Has Produced a Lot of Guilt in Parents This  verse  has  produced  much  shame  in  Christian  parents  because  it  seems  to promise  that  if  parents  will  start  their  children  out  on  the  right  way  when  they are young, when they are grown they will continue to live the right way. On the other hand, if you do not raise your children in the right way, they will live the wrong  kind  of  life.  The  logic  seems  clear  and  straightforward  from  the Scriptures. How your children turn out reveals whether or not you started them out right. Therefore, if you have grown children who are ungodly or did not turn out  right,  the  obvious  conclusion  is  that  you  did  not  raise  them  properly.  So added  to  the  heartache  of  a  child  not  walking  with  the  Lord  is  the  biblical condemnation of your parenting. You blew it. You are the one who messed up. But is that really what Proverbs 22:6 teaches? Some propose a solution to this apparent  dilemma  to  try  to  resolve  the  problem  for  Christian  parents.  The "}
{"Page": 139, "Info": "solution, they say, is that Proverbs 22:6 is not a promise but rather a general rule of thumb. Longman argues for this solution. He writes, It sounds like a promise but a proverb does not give a promise. The book of Proverbs advises its hearers in ways that are most likely to lead them to desired consequences if all things are equal. It is much more likely that a child will be a responsible adult if trained in the right path. . . . The point is that this proverb encourages parents to train their children, but does not guarantee if they do so their children will never stray. (Proverbs, 405) Thus, the argument goes, all things being equal, the usual outcome of life will be that if you raise your children the right way, they will live the right kind of life, but  that  is  not  always  the  case.  So  can  we  fix  this  problem-and  ease  our consciences-by saying it is not a promise? I  find  this  approach  to  Proverbs-and  any  portion  of  Scripture-extremely problematic. Nowhere else would we say of a biblical passage that it is mostly true but not always true. Some will object-like Dr. Longman, a wonderful Old Testament scholar-that we have to approach each genre of the Bible in its own unique way, and this is the way wisdom literature works. But is this correct? Do we want to say, for example, that if you trust in the Lord will all your heart, do not  lean  on  your  own  understanding,  and  in  all  your  ways  acknowledge  him, then  he  will  usually  direct  your  paths?  We  believe  there  is  a  better  way  to understand Proverbs. The biblical proverbs are promises that are generally true now, but are always ultimately true in the end (Dever, The Message, 510). You can count on them. So what are we to make of this specific verse then? Does it mean that if I do right by my children now by taking them to church, reading the Bible to them, and leading them in their prayers, I am guaranteed they will turn out right? Does it  mean  if  my  children  do  not  turn  out  right  as  adults,  somehow  it  is  my  fault because I did not train them right? What if it is too late, and I did not start them out right, and now they are grown? While this verse is a promise, we think the accepted understanding of it is based on a bad interpretation that showed up in the  translation  of  it.  We  need  to  see  that  Proverbs  22:6  is  actually  the  reverse side of a promise. Here is what we mean. This Verse Is a Warning to Correct Your Children There  is  a  different  way  to  understand  Proverbs  22:6  that  we  have  found extremely helpful. Instead of being a promise that if you do right, your children "}
{"Page": 140, "Info": "will turn out right, it is a reverse promise-a warning-that if you do not correct your children when they are young, they will run amok wanting their own way as an adult. Almost every English translation of this verse adds a word to the text that is not in the Hebrew. The English says something along the lines of \"train a child in the right way\" or the \"way he should go.\" The word \"right\" or \"should\" is not in the Hebrew. Literally the verse should be rendered, \"Train a child in his way, and  when  he  is  old  he  will  not  depart  from  it\"  (Murphy  and  Huwiler,  Proverbs, 109).  In  the  Hebrew,  there  is  no  descriptor  or  qualifier  on  \"way,\"  so  English translations  add  one  like  \"right\"  or  \"should.\"  They  do  this  to  aid  in  the translation by making an interpretation of the verse, but we think it is better to take  the  text  as  is.  After  all,  the  translation  that  puts  the  blame  on  the  parents does not fit with the rest of Proverbs, where a son makes his own wise or foolish choices and is held accountable for them. The young man is responsible for how he interacts with the gang of his peers or whether he receives the advances of the immoral woman (2:1-22) (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 206). The  question  would  be  then,  if  we  take  the  literal  translation,  what  does  it mean to \"Start a youth out on his way\"? There are two options (Garrett, Proverbs, 288). First, train a youth according to his nature or bent. Each of your children is different,  thus  you  must  become  an  expert  on  each  one  and  figure  out  the  best way  to  communicate  and  teach  each  one.  This  is  a  perfectly  acceptable interpretation,  but  it  is  not  the  one  that  best  fits  the  flow  of  Proverbs  because Proverbs  says  our  nature  is  broken.  Proverbs  teaches  that  foolishness  is  in  our hearts, and it needs to be corrected (20:9; 22:15). Waltke points out that the other six  references  to  the  \"youth\"  in  Proverbs  characterize  his  way  as  foolish  (1:4; 7:7; 22:15; 23:13; 29:15) (Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 205). The  clear  warning  of  the  Proverbs-despite  the  messaging  we  receive  from Disney  movies-is  that  following  your  own  heart  or  your  own  \"way\"  is  the epitome  of  foolishness.  Doing  what  is  right  in  your  own  eyes  leads  to  death (14:12).  Proverbs  teaches  that  God  gives  young  people  to  parents  who  are supposed  to  correct  this  condition.  You  see,  the  best  interpretation  of  Proverbs 22:6 is sort of sarcastic: Let a child have his way when he is young, and when he is  old,  he  will  continue  to  insist  on  having  his  way  (Clifford,  Proverbs,  197).  In other  words,  if  you  start  by  letting  a  young  person  have  his  own  way,  he  will continue  on  that  dead-end  road  when  he  grows  up.  Thus,  this  verse  is  the  flip side  of  a  promise;  it  is  a  warning  that  parents  must  correct  their  children's "}
{"Page": 141, "Info": "foolish character before it is set. Children left to their own devices will destroy themselves. Two other verses help us to see why this is the right interpretation in the flow of Proverbs. Proverbs 22:15 says, \"Foolishness is bound to the heart of a youth; a  rod  of  discipline  will  separate  it  from  him.\"  And  29:15  states,  \"A  rod  of correction  imparts  wisdom,  but  a  youth  left  to  himself  is  a  disgrace  to  his mother.\" Children do not have to be taught to do wrong because it is already in their hearts, but they do need to be corrected and shown what is right. One day my ( Jon's) young son wanted a toy his sister was playing with, and when she didn't give it to him, he reached up and yanked her hair. I can assure you that he had  never  seen  any  one  of  us  do  that  before.  He  had  never  seen  me  pull  my wife's hair because I wanted the TV remote. Where did he get that behavior? He got it from his sin nature! All people need discipline and correction to do right, and you harm your children if you do not correct them. Proverbs  29:15  implies  that  directing  and  correcting  your  children  will  take different forms over time: spanking (\"a rod\") and reproof (not leaving a youth to himself).  Spanking  can  be  the  only  way  to  get  through  to  a  young  child sometimes  because  all  the  reasoning  in  the  world  will  not  help.  An  ancient Egyptian  proverb  said  of  young  boys  that  they  have  ears  on  their  backsides (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 1-15, 574). A study at Calvin College actually shows that kids spanked between the ages of two and six earned better grades in school and had a sunnier outlook on life (Black, \"Spanking Makes Kids Better\"). There is no room for physical abuse of children, but the Bible is also clear that a lack of discipline is a way to abuse your children. However, a verbal reprimand almost always  works  better  as  children  age,  and  they  should  be  able  to  heed  a  verbal rebuke as they grow in maturity. The  main  point  is  clear.  Proverbs  says  that  left  to  themselves,  children  will choose the wrong and destructive path. Human beings are not innocent, basically good, or wise. The parental task is to intervene before folly is set and our kids walk off toward hell. Leaving your young child to make his or her own decisions without correction from you is foolish. Leaving teens of the opposite sex alone together is foolish. Letting a four-year-old have his way all the time is foolish. We are to heed the warning of Proverbs 22:6-don't leave your children to their own way or you might watch them march straight into hell! Proverbs 22:6 moves against the buddy-parent philosophy of so many. If you allow your child to be self-centered now, they will be later (and no one will like them!). You have to say no sometimes. Many times! Do not turn your child into "}

They don't need to always get their way. I know the world says that repressing things is harmful, but the world's wisdom is foolish. There is an insightful  article  in  The  Atlantic  by  Lori  Gottlieb  where  a  teacher  indicted  the inability of parents to just say no. Another teacher I spoke with, a 58-year-old mother of grown children who has been teaching kindergarten for 17 years, told me she feels that parents are increasingly getting in the way of their children's development. \"I see the way their parents treat them,\" she said, \"and there's a big adjustment when they get into my class. It's good for them to realize that they aren't the center of the world, that sometimes other people's feelings matter more than theirs at a particular moment-but it only helps if they're getting the same limit-setting at home. If not, they become impulsive, because they're not thinking about anybody else.\" This same teacher-who asked not to be identified, for fear of losing her job-says she sees many parents who think they're setting limits, when actually, they're just being wishy-washy. \"A kid will say, \u2018Can we get ice cream on the way home?' And the parent will say, \u2018No, it's not our day. Ice-cream day is Friday.' Then the child will push and negotiate, and the parent, who probably thinks negotiating is \u2018honoring her child's opinion,' will say, \u2018Fine, we'll get ice cream today, but don't ask me tomorrow, because the answer is no!'\" The teacher laughed. \"Every year, parents come to me and say, \u2018Why won't my child listen to me? Why won't she take no for an answer?' And I say, \u2018Your child won't take no for an answer, because the answer is never no!'\" (Gottlieb, \"How to Land Your Kid in Therapy\") The  main  point  of  Proverbs  22:6  is  that  the  parental  task  is  to  intervene  and correct  your  children's  foolishness  before  it  becomes  set  later  in  life.  If  we  do not, the results will be disastrous in all kinds of ways. It will lead to selfishness, relational  issues,  impulse-control  problems,  an  inability  to  submit  to  a  boss's authority,  and  unwillingness  to  accept  the  consequences  of  actions.

Wait until he is 21, and then let him \"decide for himself.\" 4.  Avoid  the  use  of  the  word  \"wrong.\"  It  may  develop  a  guilt  complex. This will condition him to believe later, when he is arrested for stealing a car, that society is against him and he is being persecuted. 5.  Pick up everything he leaves lying around-books, shoes, clothes. Do everything  for  him  so  that  he  will  be  experienced  in  throwing  all responsibility on others. 6.  Let him read any printed matter he can get his hands on. Be careful that the silverware and drinking glasses are sterilized, but don't worry about his mind feasting on garbage. 7.  Quarrel  frequently  in  the  presence  of  your  children.  In  this  way  they will not be too shocked when the home is broken up later. 8.  Give the child all the spending money he wants. Never let him earn his. Why should he have things as tough as you did? 9.  Satisfy  his  every  craving  for  food,  drink,  and  comfort.  See  that  every sensual desire is gratified. Denial may lead to harmful frustration. 10.  Take  his  part  against  neighbors,  teachers,  policemen.  They  are  all prejudiced against your child. 11.  When  he  gets  into  real  trouble,  apologize  to  yourself  by  saying,  \"I never could do anything with him!\" 12.  Prepare yourself for a life of grief. You'll surely have it. This Verse Tells Us Our Children's Greatest Need Is the Good News about Jesus Proverbs  22:6  ultimately  demonstrates  that  our  children's  greatest  need  is  the good  news  about  Jesus.  Our  role  is  not  simply  behavior  modification  that  will turn our children into Pharisees, or into rebels when the bribes for good behavior and  threats  toward  bad  behavior  go  away.  No,  our  goal  for  our  children  is  life transformation  through  Jesus.  Proverbs  is  clear  that  discipline  is  evangelism: \"Don't withhold discipline from a youth; if you punish him with a rod, he will "}
{"Page": 144, "Info": "not die. Punish him with a rod, and you will rescue his life from Sheol\" (23:13- 14). Discipline is a rescue mission. We are to step in to rescue our kids from hell and  the  path  that  leads  there.  If  we  do  not  correct  our  children,  they  will  not recognize their sin or that they will be held accountable. Some Christian parents misunderstand grace as calling for a laissez-faire attitude toward discipline, but that is deadly. Loving discipline shows our children that there are consequences and accountability for sinful actions, and it demonstrates that there is a standard of  right  and  wrong-one  that  they  have  fallen  short  of,  and  thus  they  need  a Savior. Discipline  is  not  simply  meting  out  punishment;  it  is  an  opportunity  for  a gospel  conversation.  We  want  to  avoid  moralism  in  favor  of  gospel-driven discipline where you talk to your child in the discipline moment, confessing that your love for them is unconditional-as is God's love for them-and you are a sinner  in  need  of  God's  grace  as  much  as  they  are.  I  try  when  I  discipline  my children to identify with them that I know what it is like to be selfish, frustrated, or angry, and that is why I am so thankful for Jesus, who offers forgiveness for my sins. And if you have grown children and think it's too late to get through to them because of how you royally messed up, perhaps a confession of your sins in  parenting,  your  appeal  to  them  for  forgiveness,  and  your  confidence  in  the mercy of God might go a long way in bringing healing and transformation. Conclusion Proverbs  22:6  should  not  cause  guilt  in  parents  as  much  as  it  should  cause vigilance.  We  are  not  to  be  buddy-buddy  with  our  kids  in  the  way  the  world says. We are  on a rescue mission  where we must lovingly correct our children because  there  is  foolishness  in  their  hearts.  So  let  us  heed  the  warning  of Proverbs  22:6  and  graciously  correct  our  children,  so  that  in  glory  we  can  say with our Lord Jesus, \"Here I am with the children God gave me\" (Heb 2:13).

However, there  are  some  instances  where  it  seems  like  the  Bible  does  say  one  thing  and then another. We will look at a frequently cited one here in Proverbs 26:4-5. Even in ancient times, the Talmud noted an \"apparent\" contradiction in this text (see discussion in Longman, Proverbs, 464).

Why would they put these two verses right next to each other? If they were  trying  to  get  away  with  something-like  putting  a  contradiction  in  the Bible-they would separate these verses and hope people did not notice it. The reason the sages put Solomon's proverbs together like this is because they want us  to  read  them  together!  Together-not  separately-they  give  the  true  picture of reality on how to discern a situation and to know when to correct a fool. Don't Stoop to the Fool's Level by Playing His Game There  are  some  types  of  fools  and  situations  where  you  should  not  rebuke, correct, confront, or answer. Wisdom is the discernment to read the person or the situation  and  know  if  that  is  the  case.  How  do  you  know  if  you  should  not correct or answer someone? If your answer to them will require stooping to their level, avoid answering them.26 If your answer or attempt at correction will do no good,  if  it  will  drain  your  energy  and  not  get  anyone  anywhere,  it's  best  to remain quiet (Longman, Proverbs, 212). Proverbs 9:7-9 says something similar: The one who corrects a mocker will bring abuse on himself; the one who rebukes the wicked will get hurt. Don't rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke the wise, and he will love you. Instruct the wise, and he will be wiser still; teach the righteous, and he will learn more. If, despite your best efforts, the person will not be corrected, then stay quiet. If you  only  hurt  yourself  by  playing  his  game,  stay  quiet.  There  are  people  who will ask you questions but do not really want to hear your answers because they think  they  know  it  all.  Do  not  waste  your  valuable  time  thinking  through  and answering their questions, e-mails, text messages, or Facebook posts. Proverbs 26:4 also teaches us not to answer a fool in a foolish way.27 Do not lie, mock, or speak unkindly just to get your point across or to bust them. Even though you think you just have to win the argument and shut them up, it would "}
{"Page": 148, "Info": "still  be  wrong  to  exaggerate  to  make  your  point.  Don't  fight  fire  with  fire; otherwise you are on the same level with the fool and guilty before God. And no honor is given to the fool (v. 1) (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 129) because he is under judgment. There  are  some  people  you  should  not  answer,  correct,  or  engage  in conversation.  Do  not  play  her  game  or  play  by  his  rules.  If  you  are  going  to answer  them,  change  up  the  rules!  For  example,  when  doing  evangelism,  you need to recognize comments or questions that will sidetrack the conversation and do  your  best  to  bypass  them.  Someone  says,  \"Well,  a  thousand  years  ago Christians killed people in the Crusades; why would I want to be a Christian?\" I could spend a lot of time answering that and get off track. Or I could kindly say, \"Why don't we discuss that another day and right now keep the focus on what Jesus did?\" Keep the focus on Jesus, not objections about obscure manuscripts, battles  that  took  place  a  millennia  ago,  or  why  there  are  so  many  different denominations.  Do  not  let  people  deflect  their  own  conviction  or  their  need  to deal with Jesus by getting off into tangential and unprofitable arguments. But this is true in any type of conversation, dialogue, or relational interaction. In any family interaction, church relationship, office dynamic, blog post, or any kind  of  situation  where  advice  is  being  given  to  solve  people's  problems,  you can be dragged into playing a game that you don't need to play. Refuse to play the  fool's  game  with  anyone!  You  need  to  be  aware  of  whether  or  not  you should engage the person. It is so easy for us to get sucked into responding on Facebook or Twitter or at the water cooler because we want to be seen as right. That  leads  to  a  long,  drawn-out  argument  and  then  stalemate.  Sometimes  you just need to let it go. As sportswriter and commentator Skip Bayless says, \"Don't press \u2018send.'\" One time a man whose son was dating a Hindu tried to convince me that Jesus would  have  dated  non-Christians.  He  was  not  trying  to  have  an  actual discussion;  he  was  just  justifying  his  son's  behavior.  That  is  not  even  worth responding  to.  Do  not  let  someone  get  a  rise  out  of  you.  Don't  get  into  never- ending arguments where you have to have the last word in your marriage or in a friendship. However, do not use Proverbs 26:4 as an excuse to chicken out because there is  also  a  time  to  answer.  It  is  certainly  easier  to  step  back  and  not  engage  in many  situations.  Most  people  don't  like  to  ruffle  feathers.  But  you  can't  use verse 4 as an excuse to chicken out. Sometimes we are called to correct a fool so that he does not think he is wise (v. 5). "}
{"Page": 149, "Info": "Correct a Fool So He Doesn't Think He Is Wise Proverbs  26:5  says  that  there  are  some  fools  and  situations  that  should  be confronted, answered, or corrected. Don't stay quiet or be passive in those cases because if you don't answer them, they'll be wise in their own eyes, and verse 12 says that's destructive: \"Do you see a person who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.\" Letting people think they are wise when they are not is deadly. Proverbs repeatedly warns those who think they are wise  judgment.  Letting  your  children indiscriminately run through parking lots without correcting them is foolish and dangerous. You would say something because you do not want them to get hit by a car. In the same way, there are people around you who have patterns of sin and  foolishness  in  their  lives  that  will  ruin  them,  and  God  has  put  you  in  their lives to lovingly say something! they  are  headed  toward  that  For  some,  it  will  do  good  to  correct  them  because  they  might  listen!  Some might listen immediately. Others might get mad initially, storm off, and not talk to  you  for  a  while.  But  then,  after  having  some  time  to  mull  it  over,  they  will come to the realization that you were right and only said something because you cared for them. Also,  there  are  times  when  there  are  others  around  who  will  be  hurt  by  the person's  foolishness,  so  you  cannot  stay  silent  because  others  might  be  led astray.  Do  not  tolerate  foolishness  in  such  a  way  that  others  watching  and listening think the person is right. So lovingly correct them-show their folly- without lowering yourself, if it will do that person or others good. If you remain passive, it will look like you are giving your approval of their \"wisdom.\" The  motivation  of  verse  5  is  not  you  telling  someone  the  way  it  is.  Some people like to brag, \"I'm not unkind; I just tell it like it is.\" No, you are a jerk. There is a big difference between being a truth-teller and acting like a jerk. The proper motivation is for their good. If we remain passive, they might think they are  smart  because  no  one  is  correcting  them.  This  is  true  in  matters  like evangelism  where  people  might  be  saying  false  things  about  God,  in  marital issues where a coworker is giving ungodly advice to someone like \"get out of the marriage,\" or in personal struggles where people just do not see things clearly. Speak up in those situations! But it's also true in \"little\" matters like spending, laziness, or bad thinking on a specific subject. You will regret not speaking up when you had the chance, especially if they keep hurting themselves. Wisdom Is the Discernment to Know When to Correct "}
{"Page": 150, "Info": "Solomon's point is this: Wisdom is the discernment to read people and situations and  know  when  to  respond  and  when  to  stay  silent.  Wisdom  is  growing  in  the knowledge of when to correct someone and when not to correct them. You grow in discerning the outcome. You come to know when answering will help him or when you are just playing his game. Daily life is filled with both situations, and wisdom is the ability to assess them and decide what to do. Goldsworthy writes, Thus, one situation is best handled by refusing to play the fool's game with him, while another demands some rejoinder to his folly. Life is full of both kinds of situations. . . . One must assess each situation carefully and decide whether to engage the fool or disengage from his company. (Tree of Life, 165) Wisdom means growing in that kind of decision-making. Proverbs has taught us that Wisdom is not a thing; Wisdom is a person-Jesus of  Nazareth.  So  growth  in  him  does  not  just  mean  growth  in  not  sinning  as much, although it does include that (Moore, Walking the Line). It also means growth in discernment! You begin to know whether answering will get you nowhere or will  help  the  person  or  others  around  them.  This  is  what  growing  in Christlikeness  looks  like.  You  are  able  to  perceive  motivations  and  outcomes. You are able to let things go and remain silent when you should. You are able to be bold and speak up when you should. The Power to Grow in Discernment Is in Christ, Not in You If  you  do  not  grow  in  this  kind  of  discernment,  it  reveals  you  have  a  problem with Jesus. You are not walking with him as you should because of some idol in your life. If you are too cowardly to confront, your idol may be self-approval or pride.  If  you  are  a  jerk  who  loves  to  tell  people  off,  your  idol  might  be  self- justification. But if you are not able to read a situation and know when to speak up or let it lie, you are not growing in Christlikeness. After all, Jesus amazed people with this ability. He knew when to stay silent because a reply would do no good. And he knew when to correct. He could read people and situations and know exactly how to respond or not respond. For  example,  in  Matthew  15:1-9  the  Pharisees  challenged  Jesus  because  his disciples  did  not  follow  the  rules  for  hand  washing.  Jesus  turned  around  and swatted them for using their rules to justify not honoring their moms and dads. He revealed their hypocrisy so that they would not be wise in their own eyes or the eyes of the crowd. In Matthew 16 Peter foolishly rebuked Jesus concerning "}
{"Page": 151, "Info": "the  cross,  and  Jesus  answered  him  rather  directly  to  correct  his  folly,  \"Get behind  me,  Satan!\"  (v.  23).  What  Peter  was  saying  was  satanic,  so  Jesus corrected him. Jesus  also  knew  when  to  not  play  people's  games.  The  chief  priests  tried  to challenge  Jesus's  authority  in  the  temple  by  asking  by  what  authority  he  did what  he  did.  Jesus  knew  their  game,  so  he  asked  a  follow-up  question  about John's  baptism  that  the  priests  refused  to  answer.  He  refused  to  answer  fools according  to  their  folly.  Matthew  21:27  says,  \"So  they  answered  Jesus,  \u2018We don't know.' And he said to them, \u2018Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.'\" He refused to play their game. Jesus knew when people were testing him. In Matthew 22:15-17 the Pharisees sought  to  entrap  Jesus  in  his  words  by  asking  about  taxes.  But  Matthew  22:18 tells us, \"Perceiving their malicious intent, Jesus said, \u2018Why are you testing me, hypocrites?'\" Jesus discerned the situation and knew how to answer about taxes, the resurrection of the dead, the greatest commandment, and David's Son so that Matthew 22:46 says, \"No one was able to answer him at all, and from that day no one dared to question him anymore.\" Jesus  knows  how  to  read  people  and  situations.  He  knows  when  to  answer, how to answer, and when to stay silent. After all, he did not answer the Jewish leaders' questions at his trial (Matt 26:63), he refused to speak to Herod (Luke 23:9), and he amazed Pilate by not answering him just before he was crucified (Mark 15:5). Conclusion Jesus grew in wisdom (Luke 2:52), which means he grew in the ability to read people and situations. Growth in Christlikeness will mean growth in the area of discernment.  Jesus  produces  this  in  his  followers.  We  see  this  with  the  deacon Stephen  at  his  trial;  the  opponents  could  not  resist  Stephen's  wisdom  (Acts 6:10). So if you are not growing in this ability, confess that to God, repent of it, and  go  to  Jesus.  Cry  out  to  him,  \"Lord,  show  me  where  I  lack  discernment. Judge  me  in  this  and  give  me  wisdom\"  (Moore,  Walking  the  Line).  Lack  of discernment might be because you are not a believer and need to trust Jesus for the first time. It might be because you are a believer but not walking with Christ in this area of your life. But the answer is the same for all-repent and believe! "}

Look to Christ for Salvation from Sin (30:10-14). III. Look at the World through the Lens of Christ (30:15-33). A. Warnings about uncontrolled appetites B. Instruction in wisdom M y ( Jon's) dad taught me and instilled many things in me, but how to fix things was definitely not one of them. He is mechanically challenged. Not having that skill in my own life did not prove to be a problem until Ashley and I started  having  children.  So  Ashley's  dad,  Jimmy,  who  is  really  good  at  fixing things, began to try to teach me how to do certain things. He and I put together all  kinds  of  things  like  cribs,  rockers,  and  swing  sets.  Inevitably  what  would happen is that, even though Jimmy is good at putting things together, we would rush into the project, put it together, and then notice that we had made a mistake somewhere along the way. For example, we put a sofa table together, and when we  finished  we  noticed  the  legs  of  the  table  were  facing  outward  rather  than inward like they were supposed to. At that point, we had to go back and actually look  at  the  instructions  for  the  first  time,  see  where  we  went  wrong,  and  start again the right way. We had to go the manufacturer's manual to see how it really worked so we could do the job in accordance with the furniture's design. Proverbs  30  gets  at  this  kind  of  thing  in  the  grand  scheme  of  life  when  it comes  to  wisdom  and  your  way  in  the  world.  There  is  a  pattern  to  the  world. There is a certain way that it works, and you need to live according to the pattern because  that's  wise.  Wisdom  is  the  skill  to  live  according  to  that  pattern.  To understand what that skill is, you have to go the Maker-the one who created the world-to see how the world works. That is what Proverbs 30 is all about, and it shows us three important truths. Look to Christ for Wisdom "}
{"Page": 154, "Info": "Look to Christ for Wisdom PROVERBS 30:1-9 The author of this passage is Agur the son of Jakeh (v. 1). We do not know who Agur is because this is the only place he is mentioned in the Bible. Some do not take this as a proper name but rather interpret the meaning of the names as \"I am a  sojourner  (Agur)  and  son  of  Yahweh  the  Holy  (  Jakeh)\"  since  Jakeh  is shorthand for \"Yahweh the Holy\" (see Skehan, Studies, 27-45). That is a possible interpretation. Regardless, the author is a follower of the one true God. Not only do we not know exactly who Agur is, but we also do not know the recipients to whom he is writing: Ithiel and Ucal.28 What we do know is that the Holy Spirit of God breathed out these words for us. Agur starts the passage in verses 2-3 by claiming to be ignorant: I am more stupid than any other person, and I lack a human's ability to understand. I have not gained wisdom, and I have no knowledge of the Holy One. He  confesses  that  he  is  limited  when  it  comes  to  wisdom.  But  Proverbs repeatedly  indicates  that  humility  is  the  first  step  to  wisdom.  To  become  wise, you need to recognize that you are not and look to God for it. Just  as  Solomon  recognized  that  wisdom  begins  with  fear  of  the  Lord,  Agur recognizes that wisdom begins with God-with knowledge of the Holy One. Not only does wisdom reside with God, but it also resides with God's Son. Agur asks a series of rhetorical questions in verse 4 to indicate humanity's finitude and to point out that wisdom belongs to the Almighty Creator and his Son. No human has gone up to heaven and come back down. No human can gather the wind in his  hands.  No  human  created  the  world.  We  read  this  from  a  different  vantage point than Agur. Agur asks the name of the son, but he does not know it. We do know  it-Jesus  Christ!  We  know  that  Jesus  is  the  God-Man  who  came  down from heaven as wisdom for us. Goldsworthy points out, Agur's question in verse 4 is answered directly in Jesus's reply to Nicodemus in John 3:13, \"No one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven-the Son of man.\" (Tree of Life, 186) The  point  is  that  God's  Son  is  the  one  who  has  access  to  God's  wisdom because he came from heaven, so look to God and his Son for wisdom. How do you do that? I think verses 5-6 give us the answer: Every word of God is pure; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. Don't add to his words, or he will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar. "}
{"Page": 155, "Info": "God reveals this unknowable wisdom to us in his Word, so we must submit to it. For us to know wisdom, God must reveal it to us, and he has in his Word. His Word is true, a shield to those who trust in him, and sufficient. Don't add to it. There is a warning to those who do. Don't sit in judgment on God's Word as if it's  lacking  something.  That  was  the  problem  for  humanity  in  Genesis  3.  They did not see God's word as sufficient for their lives. We do the same thing. We know what the Bible says, but we think our ideas in certain situations are better. We often come to Scripture and act like God forgot to put the exception clause in  there  for  our  case.  People  will  say,  \"Well,  I  know  what  God  says  about divorce,  but  you  don't  know  my  husband,\"  or,  \"Well,  I  know  what  God  says about parenting, but you don't know my children,\" or, \"Well, I know what the Bible  says  about  submission  to  authority,  but  you  don't  know  my  boss.\"  We think  our  case  is  the  exception  that  somehow  just  got  left  out  of  the  Bible. Proverbs warns that God will rebuke you and prove you to be a liar if you act like  the  Word  is  not  enough  for  you.  In  fact,  Revelation  threatens  a  curse  to those who do this (Rev 22:18-19). Agur  then  turns  around  and  does  for  himself  what  he  has  recommended  for others.  He  looks  to  the  Lord  for  wisdom.  He  humbly  depends  upon  God  for wisdom  by  asking  for  it  in  prayer  (Longman,  Proverbs,  524-25).  James  1:5  says that if we lack wisdom, we should ask God for it in prayer and he will give it to us generously. Agur prays for wisdom in Proverbs 30:7-9. Agur asks two things for his life that he knows he can't produce in his own power. He is saying that in his own power he can't be an honest or content person. He says he will depend on God to grant those things because his own human effort can't save him from deception and greed (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 478). We learn from this that the power does not lie with us. The two things that he asks God for are honesty and contentment. The main emphasis is on finances, and it seems that the subject of deception introduces the subject  of  money  because  money  can  lie  to  you.  Garrett  argues  that  the  two requests are actually (1) do not give me poverty and (2) do not give me wealth, and  the  reference  to  deception  refers  to  poverty  and  wealth  (Garrett,  Proverbs, 238). Poverty lies to you: \"God can't help you. God won't provide for you. You need  to  help  yourself.\"  And  riches  lie  to  you:  \"You  don't  need  God  because everything is good in your life. You are doing a great job by yourself. Depend on you not him.\" Agur pleads with the Lord to feed him with the food that he needs. Give me my daily bread. Let me have just enough for my needs to be met. Help me to be "}
{"Page": 156, "Info": "content  with  that  and  not  greedy  for  more.  Why?  He  gives  the  reasons  for  his supplication. First, if he has too much, he will deny the Lord (v. 9). After all, the reason God gave Israel daily manna from heaven in the wilderness was to teach them to depend on him and not on financial provision. He wanted them to learn that  man  lives  by  the  word  of  God,  not  by  bread.  In  Deuteronomy  8  God  says that the purpose of the manna in the wilderness was that Israel was about to enter a land flowing with milk and honey, and when they got to that abundance they were  going  to  forget  God  and  think  they  did  this  on  their  own.  That  is  what Proverbs  30  is  warning  us  about.  If  you  have  too  much,  you  won't  depend  on God. It's not saying that all rich people are greedy or profaners, but it is saying that wealth is so deceptive that it is hard for the rich to recognize their need of God. Second, if he has too little, he will be tempted to steal (v. 9). If he is poor, he will be  tempted  to cheat  on  his  tax return,  misuse  petty cash,  be  stingy  toward the  poor,  or  take  money  off  his  mom's  dresser.  He  makes  the  strangest  of requests to American ears because he  wants the middle ground-not too  much and not too little. The point is that both riches and poverty can lead to a lack of dependence on God.  If  you  are  rich,  you  think  you  do  not  need  God  because  you  can  do  this yourself. And if you are poor, you think obviously God isn't helping you so you need to do this yourself. Agur asks God to give him the kind of life where he can learn  to  depend  on  and  praise  God's  name  the  best-the  way  of  contentment. The motivation for his prayer is not his own needs; the motivation for his prayer is the name of God! God, glorify yourself by teaching me to lean wholly on you. Look to Christ for Salvation from Sin PROVERBS 30:10-14 Proverbs  30:15-33  gives  a  list  of  numerical  sayings.  The  verses  between  the numerical  sayings  help  us  understand  the  meaning  of  the  numerical  sayings (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 481-82). He starts by talking about immorality in verses 10-14 to set up the numerical sayings. He says not to slander a servant to his master or he'll curse you and you will become guilty (v. 10). Don't ruin an employee's  reputation  by  slandering  them  to  the  boss,  making  fun  of  them, telling lies, stabbing them in the back, or being overly critical. That person will respond by verbally cursing you, and God will uphold the curse. Yikes! You are being foolish and wicked when you slander and gossip against someone, and by doing  that  you  are  incurring  judgment  on  yourself.  When  the  person  retaliates "}
{"Page": 157, "Info": "verbally,  it  indicts  you  before  God  for  your  own  wickedness  (Waltke,  Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 483). In  fact,  judgment  of  sin  governs  this  whole  section.  Agur  describes  in  this section behavior that deserves condemnation. So verse 10 sets up the listing of verses  11-14  and  gives  us  a  key  for  how  to  interpret  them.  In  verses  11-14  he gives  four  \"generations\"  or  types  of  sinners  who  will  be  condemned  by  God (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 146). First,  there  is  a  generation  that  curses  instead  of  blessing  its  parents  (v.  11). The Bart Simpsons of the world who are smart-alecks to their parents; the angst- ridden  teens  who  yell  at  their  parents,  \"I  hate  you!\";  the  bratty  three-year-old who shouts \"No!\" to his parents' directions; or even the grown child who refuses to  provide  care  for  aging  parents.  I  (  Jon)  remember  when  I  pastored  in Louisville,  we  were  hit  with  a  huge  ice  storm  one  winter  that  left  thousands without power. We received a call from the grown daughter of one of our elderly members  who  was  worried  about  her  parents  and  wanted  the  church  to  take bread and milk to them and make sure that they were OK. We were happy to do so. The problem was that this grown-and fully healthy-daughter lived in the same  town  as  her  parents  and  she  did  not  lift  a  finger  to  help  them  herself. Proverbs says this sort of behavior is condemned before God. The behavior that honors  God  is  what  Christ  displayed-obeying  his  parents  in  childhood  (Luke 2:51) and caring for his aging mother as he died ( John 19:26-27). Second,  there  is  a  generation  that  is  pure  in  its  own  eyes  but  is  not  washed from  its  filth  (30:12).  This  verse  presents  a  disgusting  image  of  self- righteousness and hypocrisy. The word for \"filth\" in the Hebrew is literally the word for dung.29 The picture is of someone who is unaware that they stepped in dog mess, and now it's smeared on their clothes. They think everything is fine with their lives morally, yet they are nasty. This is what self-righteousness looks like to God. Those who think they are not sinners and look down on others as if they  are  better  than  them  look  disgusting  in  God's  eyes!  When  we  try  to categorize  sins  by  calling  the  sins  of  the  culture  worse  than  the  sins  of  the church,  that  is  gross  to  God.  The  word  pure  refers  to  those  who  are  able  to approach  the  presence  of  God  in  the  temple.  These  folks  think  they  can  when they can't. Proverbs is clear-like the rest of the Bible-that you cannot come to God  unless  you  first  know  that  you  are  filthy.  The  first  step  to  salvation  is recognizing  you  are  not  clean  and  coming  to  God  through  Jesus  for  cleansing. After all, Jesus is the one who lived out the wisdom of Proverbs (Luke 2:52). We are  always  in  danger  of  thinking  more  highly  of  ourselves  than  we  ought.  It "}
{"Page": 158, "Info": "keeps  us  from  Christ.  He  must  cleanse  us  because  we  are  not  clean  and  we cannot clean ourselves. Third,  there  is  a  prideful  generation  (v.  13).  You  can  see  it  in  their  eyes! Again, the temptation to think more highly of yourself than you ought is a strong one. Pride is almost the essence of foolishness in Proverbs. Proverbs repeatedly condemns it as the path to death. Fourth, there is a generation whose teeth are like knives that devour the poor (v. 14). There are people who are stingy toward the needy. There are those who take advantage of the poor. They slice and dice without a second thought. There are those who are simply indifferent to the oppressed. Proverbs repeatedly brings up the poor. It condemns those who mistreat them, and it honors those who are generous to them. Proverbs 30:17 gives us the outcome for these generations, specifically those who curse parents, but it applies to all: \"As for the eye that ridicules a father and despises obedience to a mother, may ravens of the valley pluck it out and young vultures eat it.\"30 This outcome is the end for those who roll their eyes at their parents.  Judgment  will  fall  on  these  generations,  and  it  is  described  in  the grossest  of  ways.  The  language  of  being  eaten  by  vultures  outside  the  camp  is the sign of someone who is accursed. God's judgment is described sometimes as being eaten by birds (Rev 19:17-18). The good news is that Jesus took this curse for us (Gal 3). The entire curse that we  deserve  for  not  honoring  our  parents,  for  our  self-righteousness,  for  our arrogance, and for our indifference to the poor crushed Jesus on the cross in our place. He was taken outside the camp, executed under the judgment of God, and then  raised  from  the  dead  in  vindication  so  all  who  believe  in  him  will  be declared right before God! So look to Jesus for salvation from your sins. Look at the World through the Lens of Christ PROVERBS 30:15-33 We must observe the way the world works; that will help us navigate skillfully through life. Only through Christ can we perceive and follow this pattern of the world.  That  is  what  is  happening  with  these  numbered  sayings.  Agur-like Solomon (1 Kgs 4:33-34)-observes nature and gives wise principles about how the world works based on his observations. Wisdom is living in accordance with the  pattern  of  the  world.  His  observations  will  do  two  things:  warn  us  about uncontrolled appetites and instruct us in wisdom. "}
{"Page": 159, "Info": "Warnings about Uncontrolled Appetites First, Agur observes that the way the world works warns us about uncontrolled appetites  for  money,  sex,  and  status.  For  example,  verses  15-16  deal  with  an uncontrolled appetite for money. A leech is a literal bloodsucker that attaches to a host to drain resources and energy. Agur uses this metaphorically to talk about an uncontrolled appetite for stuff. We even use the term \"leech\" metaphorically for  someone  who  consumes  and  consumes  but  does  not  produce.  He  says  the leech  has  two  daughters,  referring  to  the  suckers  on  the  leech  by  which  it attaches  itself  and  drains  the  host  (see  Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31,  486-87). These  two  want  more  and  more  and  more.  The  dad  can  never  get  his  girls enough  stuff!  They  cannot  ever  be  satisfied.  They  always  want  a  little  more. They  can  be  just  like  Rockefeller,  who  was  asked  how  much  money  would  be enough,  and  he  replied,  \"Just  a  little  bit  more.\"  Agur's  point  is  to  warn  you  to avoid people who are like this and to warn you not to become like them because this is the path to destruction. Don't let a leech drain you of your time, money, and energy; and don't be a greedy person who constantly craves more and more. He observes four things in nature that are never satisfied to warn you that if you are not a content person then you will never be satisfied. Sheol is never satisfied because  the  grave  always  wants  one  more  dead  body.  The  childless  womb always craves a child-like Rachel who said, \"Give me sons, or I will die!\" (Gen 30:1). The land never gets enough water because after the rain the water soaks away. Fire always wants to rage out of control. This is a warning to you if you are the kind of person who can't live within your means because your appetite is out of control and you constantly want more. The warning is that you will never be satisfied. Instead, be content with the gifts God has given you. Next,  he  warns  about  uncontrolled  appetites  for  sex  in  verses  18-20.  What Agur  observes  here  are  things  that  move  on  or  in  something  else,  but  what moves does not leave any trace of itself behind.31 They do not leave any tracks. An eagle does not leave a path in the sky, a serpent leaves no trail on a rock, and the  waves  behind  the  ship  settle  so  no  one  ever  knows  it  was  there.  The  other three observations about things that move on or in something without leaving a trace  serve  the  final,  human  observation:  the  way  of  a  man  \"with\"  (though  the best translation like the other three is \"in\") a virgin or a young woman. This is talking of the proper context of sexual relations between a man and a woman in marriage.  Unlike,  say,  a  plow  or  a  sword,  these  four  things  involve  graceful movement and leave no damage or scar. "}
{"Page": 160, "Info": "This fourth and final observation sets up the horrific nature of the next verse, which is the point. All four \"ways\" in verse 19 set up the \"way\" of verse 20. The way  of  a  man  with  his  wife  provides  the  contrast  for  the  impropriety  of  the \"way\"  of  an  adulteress-sexual  relations  outside  of  marriage.  The  adulteress eats, wipes her mouth, and says, \"I've done nothing wrong.\" She acts as though she too leaves no damage or scar, but in fact she has done something wrong; her behavior  is  vulgar,  and  she  has  caused  grievous  damage.  Eating  is  a  metaphor for  sexual  sin.  She  wipes  her  mouth,  which  means  she  removes  the  trace  or evidence of her actions, and that is the connection with the four observations of nature. She goes on and forgets all about it. She treats sex like the common act of  eating  a  meal,  just  like  so  many  treat  sex  today.  They  say  it's  just  a  natural urge that you need to satisfy, just like you eat when you're hungry. They say if you repress it, you will harm yourself; this is what we are made to do, how we evolved. It is just a bodily function. But 1 Corinthians 6 points out that is not the case at all-it is a very spiritual act with huge consequences. Paul points out that it's not just like eating a meal. This  woman  in  Proverbs  feels  as  little  compunction  about  her  illicit  act  with another  woman's  husband  as  she  does  about  eating  breakfast.  She  wipes  away the trace and goes on with no guilt, saying she's done nothing wrong. While she doesn't feel guilty, she does try to get rid of the evidence. So many people do the exact same thing. They clear an Internet history, erase an e-mail, or pay in cash at the motel so that no one finds out. Your conscience can become so seared that you  no  longer  feel  bad  sneaking  around  in  the  shadows  and  betraying  your spouse. But in fact you need to have a controlled appetite when it comes to sex, where you enjoy  it rightly in marriage, otherwise  you  will  wreck your  life and face the judgment of God. While these four things behaving properly in nature leave no trace, an immoral person's ways are before the eyes of the Lord (5:21). Finally, Agur turns to uncontrolled appetites for status and pride in Proverbs 30:21-23.  These  verses  talk  about  judgment  against  uncontrolled  appetites  for status  that  overturn  the  social  order  and  threaten  the  cosmic  order.  It  is inappropriate  for  a  servant  to  become  a  king  because  he  is  not  ready  to  rule (Longman,  Proverbs,  531).  The  former  slave  had  so  many  things  withheld  from him that when he suddenly has no constraints he will want to consume as much as possible. We observe this in history with rebellions that overthrow tyrannical governments. Often, a tyranny that is on par or worse than the previous tyranny arises in its place. (This is the point of the book  Animal  Farm in its indictment of the communists who overthrew the tsar but set up a system just as oppressive.) A "}
{"Page": 161, "Info": "perfect example of this is when Scar becomes the king of Pride Rock in The Lion King. His  appetite  is out  of  control,  so  that  he consumes  without  producing and Pride Rock becomes a wilderness. He wants to be king, but he is not the kind of person who can be king. Pride Rock-like us-needs a king who can control his appetites  so  that  the  world  works  the  way  it  should  (this  is  a  large  point  in Judges). Mufasa-like Solomon with his son in Proverbs-tries to instill this in Simba by telling him that he can't just do anything he wants. There is a circle of life-a  way  the  world  works-that  you  must  rule  by  and  by  which  Simba restores order. Next, it's inappropriate when a fool is filled with food because a fool doesn't know how to have a moderate lifestyle. He will become a drunk and a glutton. Third, it's inappropriate when an unloved woman gets a husband. She becomes a torment  (Garrett,  Proverbs,  242).  A  woman  who  goes  throughout  life  unloved starts to crave affection and attention and seek it in the wrong ways. Once she becomes married, she will crave her husband's attention in a way that damages the  relationship  (this  is  a  warning  to  dads  to  love  their  daughters  well  so  that they are not unloved). She craved the status of marriage, but now that she has it, it  is  not  enough.  Finally,  and  similar  to  the  first  observation  in  this  set,  it's inappropriate when a servant girl becomes queen. "}
{"Page": 162, "Info": "Instruction in Wisdom Not  only  does  Agur  observe  the  world  and  warn  about  uncontrolled  appetites, but  second,  he  moves  on  to  observations  that  instruct  us  in  skillful  living.  He observes  four  small  but  wise  animals  in  verses  24-28  and  then  more  stately animals in verses 29-31. You learn wisdom by observing these animals. Again, wisdom is not IQ; it's skill for life. None of these animals could take an IQ test, but they instruct us in wisdom because they have the ability to navigate through life despite the limitations they have (Longman, Proverbs, 532). So observe these animals and do likewise. He begins with four small animals.32 First, the ant survives because it provides (v. 25). The ant is wise to store up during the good times so it can be prepared during the bad times. This reality provides a nice contrast with the uncontrolled appetite  for  money  and  stuff  we  have  seen  previously  in  the  chapter.  Agur's point  in  making  this  observation  is  that  you  should  do  likewise.  You  should work hard, you should save, you should not overspend, and you should have a plan for lean times. Second, the hyrax or rock badger is a very small animal that makes its home in the cliffs so it's safe from predators against which it would be no  match  (v.  26).  The  point  is  that  you  need  to  learn  how  to  live  a  life  that  is secure  from  things  that  might  destroy  you.  You  need  to  learn  to  resist  peer pressure that might cause you to make a stupid decision that gets you in trouble. You  need  to  learn  how  to  resist  the  temptation  toward  adultery  that  would destroy your family. Third, he observes the locusts, who have no king but march in  ranks  (v.  27).  This  observation  shows  our  need  for  community  and cooperation. You need to be in a group that takes care of each other. Finally, the vulnerable little lizard that manages to live in the palace transitions to the next set of observations about stately things (v. 28). He  observes  things  that  are  stately  in  their  stride-in  contrast  with  the  small things above. He observes the lion, the rooster, and the he-goat, which leads to the  final  observation  of  the  king  (vv.  29-31).  Here  is  the  whole  point.  You observe the tiny ants and lizards because they are humble, limited creatures that despite their limitations, even because of their limitations, develop wisdom and competency. Go and do likewise.33 You learn your weaknesses, your limits, your drawbacks,  and  then  you  humble  yourself  before  God  and  you  will  be  made wise. Proverbs is often set up as a king instructing the prince so that he can rule, and you see some of that at play here. After all, the lion is a messianic animal (Gen 49:9-10), and Solomon wants to train the line of David to be wise so that "}
{"Page": 163, "Info": "the messianic kingdom might be established. But that will only happen through humility,  so  learn  from  small  creatures.  And  like  our  Messiah  who  humbled himself, we also must humble ourselves in dependence on God so we can make our way wisely through the world. These observations bear a striking resemblance to the Joseph story. Joseph- like the ant-stored food in good season in preparation for the famine. This leads to him being exalted as a ruler in Egypt who saves the world. This is fulfilled in Jesus because he is the humble King who saves the world, who can rule his own appetites, and who orders his kingdom after wisdom. Agur  ends  this  chapter  on  the  same  note  that  began  it.  Reject  foolish  self- exaltation (vv. 32-33). If you have been promoting yourself, then shut up, turn off Twitter, ignore Facebook, and repent, or it will lead to a bloody conflict. "}
{"Page": 164, "Info": "Conclusion What we have seen in Proverbs is how it's all centered on Christ. If you have a problem  with  uncontrolled  appetites  for  money,  sex,  or  status;  if  you  are  not honoring your parents; if you are mistreating the poor; or if you can't see how the world really works it's because you have a problem with Jesus! So humble yourself and seek forgiveness and transformation in Jesus Christ. There is an order to the world. The Maker made it to work a certain way. That order  is  Christ-centered.  Christ  is  the  one  who  made  the  world,  upholds  the world,  and  will  make  the  world  new  again  (Col  1:15-20).  The  pattern  of  the seasons was woven into creation with the death of winter that gives way to the resurrection of spring in order to point us to Christ. The pattern of the seven-day week was woven into creation to point us to passion week where the new Adam -the gardener-steps out of the grave into a new world on the eighth day. After all,  in  The  Lion  King,  when  the  rightful  king  overthrows  the  usurper  and  assumes the throne, even the creation itself is healed. That's the gospel (cf. Isa 11). King Jesus  sets  the  world  right,  and  you  can  only  navigate  through  that  world-you can only be wise-through him. "}

{"Page": 167, "Info": "Manhood PROVERBS 13:22 ET AL. Main Idea: A real man loves Jesus, his wife, his kids, and discipline. I. A Real Man Loves Jesus. II. A Real Man Loves (and Leads) His Wife. III. A Real Man Loves (and Leads) His Children. IV. A Real Man Loves Discipline. W hen  it  comes  to  the  topic  of  what  it  really  means  to  be  a  man,  we  are fighting  against  cultural  errors,  even  in  the  Christian  subculture.  Some people  erroneously  think  manhood  means  machismo.  They  think  a  real  man loves UFC, beer guzzling, conquests, and bravado. Others think manhood does not really matter. They would rather talk about personhood. A real man can be a kind of genderless androgyne because the sexes are equal not only in essence but also in function. Added to that confusion is the extended adolescence of our culture. Instead of young men moving out of their parents' house, finishing their education, getting a  job  to  pay  bills,  marrying  a  woman,  and  beginning  to  have  children  in  their twenties, they are now staying at home longer and starting these adult activities much  later  in  their  twenties,  or  even  in  their  thirties.  There  are  a  bunch  of middle-aged boys living in their parents' basement playing video games all day. These contrasting pictures of manhood have been around since the fall in Eden (Gen  3).  Since  sin  entered  the  world,  men  are  prone  to  be  domineering  or passive.  Adam  stood  by  passively  while  his  wife  was  taken  advantage  of,  and then passed the buck to her when God called him to give an account. Part of the curse  of  sin  is  that  now  husbands  will  want  to  rule  their  wives  in  a  harsh  and domineering way (Gen 3:16). That sin nature has been passed down to us, and now it is celebrated in our culture! We have no real shot at being real men. After all, what does that even mean? You might even ask, \"Shouldn't we want to be godly men instead of real men?\" Those  two  are  the  same  thing.  Being  a  real  man  means  being  the  man  God intended you to be both by creation and by redemption. Obviously we have all fallen miserably short of God's design. But, thank God, one man did not-Jesus. "}
{"Page": 168, "Info": "We  must  look  to  him  to  see  what  it  means  to  be  a  real  man.  Jesus  is  what  it means to be the man God intended us to be, and that is the picture of manhood presented in Proverbs. Proverbs is a man (a dad) telling another man (a son) how to be a mature man. And Jesus is the one who lived this out. Jesus is the one who grew  in  wisdom,  stature,  and  favor  with  God  and  with  people  (Luke  2:52). Therefore, only through Jesus can we see what real manhood is and live it out. This message is not just for men. Children need to hear it because boys need to aspire to be this kind of man and girls need to learn what to look for in a man. Single  women  need  this  message  because  they  need  to  know  the  kind  of  man they  should  want  to  marry.  Wives  need  this  message  because  this  is  who  they need to pray for and help their men to become. And yes, husbands and fathers need this message because they need to know what to be and what to model for their  girls  (how  godly  men  treat  women)  and  for  their  boys  (how  they  should treat women). It is vital that we get this because the consequences of not being a real man are catastrophic, as we see all around us in our broken culture. If you do not learn to become  this  kind  of  man,  you  can  destroy  your  marriage,  your  family,  your career,  and  your  reputation.  You  will  miss  out  on  the  joy  God  has  planned  for you. God tells you how the world works because he loves you and wants the best for you. So what is a real man according to Proverbs? "}
{"Page": 169, "Info": "A Real Man Loves Jesus This first point runs the risk of alienating men. What guy wants to hear that he needs to love another guy? In some ways, this is a problem in Christianity. Lots of churches have a mushy or sappy sentimentality that turns guys off. Many men think  the  church  has  been  feminized  or  that  it  is  only  suited  for  women  and children. We can even play into this with praise songs that almost sound like we are singing to Jesus like a girl would sing to her boyfriend. Lyrics like \"I want to touch you\" do not resonate with most men. Even hymns like \"In the Garden\" by C. Austin Miles play into this. What guy would normally sing about going to a garden alone with their buddy? Put your friend's name in the lyrics: I come to the garden alone, while the dew is still on the roses, and the voice I hear falling on my ear, my buddy David discloses. And David walks with me, and David talks with me, and David tells me I am his own; and the joy David and I share as we tarry there, none other has ever known. David speaks, and the sound of his voice is so sweet the birds hush their singing. . . . It is kind of creepy! On  the  other  hand,  we  do  need  to  recover  masculine  love  where  men  have deep  relationships  with  one  another.  When  I  say  that  real  men  \"love\"  Jesus,  I mean that Jesus was a real man who laid his life down for you, and you need to honor him and follow him. What  does  this  look  like  in  Proverbs?  It  looks  like  loving  the  word  of  God. Proverbs 13:13 says, \"Whoever despises the word brings destruction on himself, but he who reveres the commandment will be rewarded\" (ESV). Do you revere the  Word  of  God?  Do  you  read  it  on  your  own-not  just  in  church?  Do  you study it, listen attentively in the corporate gathering, and engage in Bible study? Loving  Jesus  also  looks  like  confession  of  sin.  Proverbs  28:13  says,  \"The  one who  conceals  his  sins  will  not  prosper,  but  whoever  confesses  and  renounces them will find mercy.\"34 You love Jesus by confessing your sin, repenting of it, and trusting in the gospel. Love of Jesus also looks like trusting the Lord (3:5-6). Wisdom is a person-Jesus Christ-so you need to be in a personal relationship "}
{"Page": 170, "Info": "with him by faith. He will make you wise in daily life. You cannot be a real man without loving Jesus! A Real Man Loves (and Leads) His Wife According to Ephesians 5, a man is called to play the role of Christ in the life of his wife. We are called to sacrificially love and lead our wives. One of the main ways  that  Proverbs  lays  this  out  is  in  the  area  of  keeping  your  covenant commitment  to  your  spouse.  Your  vows  are  promises,  and  real  men  keep  their word. Solomon repeatedly warns his son about the danger of unfaithfulness (chs. 2; 5;  6;  7).  Truly  being  faithful  to  your  covenant  commitment  means  you  are faithful  both  outwardly  and  inwardly.  Jesus  tells  us  that  even  lust  is  a  betrayal (Matt 5:27-30). This leads men to be traitors against their wives (Prov 23:26-28). As  we  see  elsewhere  in  Proverbs,  there  are  two  main  ways  that  you  can  be pulled  away:  communication  and  attraction.  Real  men  are  not  the  flirty  guy because that is dangerous. Real men do not have things like a \"work wife\" that they  flirt  with  in  the  office.  That  is  stupid  and  ridiculous.  Real  men  do  not wonder  about  their  old  high  school  girlfriend  and  message  her  on  Facebook. Real men guard their communication with the opposite sex. Also, real men do not watch shows, movies, or things on the Internet that will cause their hearts to lust for a woman who is not their wife. Real men also do not give unfettered access to a smartphone to their pubescent sons, which basically trains them in being turned on by porn. Stay in your teenager's business and do not  give  them  privacy  when  it  comes  to  \"their\"  phone  because  it  is  not  theirs! Even if your son says, \"I will pay for the phone,\" you should reply, \"Until you pay  for  the  house  you  are  using  it  in,  you  don't  get  privacy!\"  Porn  destroys marriages because it warps our minds. It makes a man view sex in a selfish way and the opposite sex as an object. This is true both before and during marriage. Be vigilant to view the opposite sex the way God wants you to view them, and fight for purity of mind. Guard your heart from unfaithfulness by watching out for communication and attraction that might pull your heart away. Heed the warning. Also, employ the positive  strategy  laid  out  by  Proverbs.  Have  a  strong  relationship  with  God's Wisdom-Jesus  Christ.  And  have  a  strong  \"offense\"  in  your  marriage relationship (5:15-20) (Longman, Proverbs, 161). Romance your wife. Be intimate with her. Be her best friend because real men love their wives. A Real Man Loves (and Leads) His Children "}
{"Page": 171, "Info": "A Real Man Loves (and Leads) His Children Real men love their children and show that love by teaching them. Teach them the Bible, teach them right from wrong, and teach them everyday wisdom. Teach them to throw a baseball, drive a car, do a job interview, tie a tie, and a hundred other things. Real  men  love  their  children  by  disciplining  them  and  attempting  to  rescue them from hell. Proverbs 13:24 says, \"The one who will not use the rod hates his son, but the one who loves him disciplines him diligently.\" A real man does not abdicate his role here and become passive like Adam. Too many men do. You need to lovingly correct your children so they know the right path. Real men love their children by working hard to provide for their family. Real men  are  not  lazy!  When  I  (  Jon)  was  growing  up,  my  pastor  told  me  that  he would  drive  his  daughters  down  to  the  poorest  areas  of  town  and  say,  \"If  you marry a lazy bum with no work ethic, you will live here.\" That may seem like a strange strategy, but Paul says that men who do not provide for their families are worse than unbelievers (1 Tim 5:8)! Proverbs 12:11 says, \"The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies lacks sense.\" If you work hard, you will be able to provide enough for your family. And through a  good  work  ethic  and  the  wise  handling  of  money,  a  real  man  can  leave  an inheritance for his children (Prov 13:22). "}
{"Page": 172, "Info": "A Real Man Loves Discipline One of the main teachings of Proverbs is that real men know how to control their appetites  for  sex,  money,  power,  status,  food,  and  alcohol.  A  real  man  is  self- controlled!  Proverbs  25:28  says,  \"A  person  who  does  not  control  his  temper  is like a city whose wall is broken down.\" A city like that is vulnerable to any kind of attack (Garrett,  Proverbs, 211). The devil loves to prey on men who are weak like  this.  He  has  destroyed  many  men  through  their  appetites.  In  contrast,  the Spirit of Jesus produces self-control in your life (Gal 5:22-23). Real  men  are  disciplined  when  it  comes  to  pride.  They  know  how  to  be humble  because  God  gives  grace  to  the  humble  (Prov  3:34).  Men  have  an appetite,  according  to  Proverbs,  to  always  be  right  in  their  own  eyes.  Men  are often headstrong. The prideful fool is right in his own eyes and will not listen to what  other  people  have  to  say  (12:15).  The  antidote  is  to  trust  the  Lord  and receive wise counsel from him and others! Real  men  discipline  their  mouths  because  a  babbling  fool  will  come  to  ruin (10:8). Proverbs 21:23 says, \"The one who guards his mouth and tongue keeps himself  out  of  trouble.\"  What  does  this  look  like  in  Proverbs?  Do  not  be  a bragger (27:2), dishonest (26:28), or someone who breaks confidence (20:19). Real men control their desire for money. They are content (30:8-9). They are honest  workers  who  earn  their  money  the  right  way  (11:1;  16:11;  20:10,23; 22:16).  They  are  generous  to  the  poor  (14:21).  And  they  have  an  eternal perspective,  knowing  that  money  and  things  are  temporary  and  do  not  last forever (23:4-5). Real men control their tempers. They are not harsh or quarrelsome. Certainly manliness  is  not  cowardice,  but  it  is  not  harshness  either.  Biblical  manhood  is tough enough to be patient and forgiving. Proverbs 16:32 highly commends men who control their tempers: \"Patience is better than power, and controlling one's emotions, than capturing a city.\" A real man is slow to anger with his wife, his children,  his  neighbors,  his  coworkers,  and  in  traffic!  A  real  man  is  also  not quarrelsome.  He  does  not  love  to  argue  and  stir  things  up  (20:3;  26:21).  He  is gentle with his words, especially toward his wife and children (15:1). Men need to be paradoxical here in some ways. Do not be a sissy-be able to rebuke men. But  also  be  able  to  lead  your  wife  and  children  gently.  Real  men  can  rebuke when they need to, stand their ground, not be tossed around by others' opinions, and not be easily led astray. They can also cool tension, lower the temperature in "}
{"Page": 173, "Info": "a heated situation, and be kind. Jesus could drive out the money changers with a whip as well as put children who just had to see him on his lap! Finally, real men are not controlled by what others think about them. Proverbs 29:25 says, \"The fear of mankind is a snare, but the one who trusts in the LORD is protected.\"  Real  men  care  more  about  what  God  thinks  about  them  than  what others do. Peer pressure causes stupid men to do stupid things, but real men are not controlled by it. They do not follow the crowd! They follow Jesus! Conclusion To sum up what a real man does, I want to show you a little blog article I ran across titled \"A Daughter Needs a Dad\" as a good way to capture this message in a list. A daughter needs a dad for many reasons: 1.  To show her that true love is unconditional [like Jesus's love for us] 2.  To teach her that her value as a person is more than the way she looks 3.  To teach her that family is more important than work 4.  To show her that a man can be trustworthy 5.  To be the safe spot she can always turn to 6.  To teach her that a man's strength is not the force of his hands or his voice, but the kindness of his heart 7.  To be the standard against which she will judge all men 8.  To help her take risks that will build her confidence 9.  To hold her when she cries 10.

Allen Ross refers to her as \"the woman of valor.\" He further notes, \"The woman of Proverbs 31 is a symbol of wisdom. . . . The "}
{"Page": 176, "Info": "Lady Wisdom in this chapter is the strongest contrast to the adulterous woman in the  earlier  chapters\"  (\"Proverbs,\"  245).  The  ancient  Hebrews  knew  her  as  the alphabet wife and mother of excellence. Derek Kidner calls her \"an Alphabet of wifely excellence\" (Proverbs, 183). In Hebrew this poem is a skillfully crafted acrostic. Each verse begins with a successive letter in the Hebrew alphabet. In English, the first few verses might look something like this: An awesome wife, who can find her? A blessed lady, her husband trusts her. A caring woman, she does him good all her life. A diligent worker, she is skillful with her hands. Through this elaborate and artful structure, this poem describes in elegant detail a woman who is \"everything from A to Z,\" a woman who, through her trust in the  Lord,  distinguishes  herself  as  an  exemplary  wife  and  mother  (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 514). Interestingly,  motherhood  is  often  discussed  in  contemporary  news  and commentary  outlets.  In  2005  Newsweek  actually  had  the  courage  to  say  \"Mother matters\" and pointed out that according to Salary.com, \"Stay-at-home moms, if compensated  for  all  the  hours  they  work,  would  net  $131,471  a  year\" (Newsweek Staff, \"Survey: Mother Matters\"). The article went on to say, 71 percent of wives say their husbands get on their nerves more than do their children. 50 percent of women say their mom is their best friend. 94 percent of dads say moms are as sexy as ever! Additionally,  many  working  women  are  reevaluating  who  they  are  and  what they want out of life. While there remains a great deal of confusion, a significant debate seems to be taking place. Consider, for example, the 2004 Time story, \"The Case  for  Staying  Home:  Why  More  Moms  Are  Opting  Out  of  the  Rat  Race.\" The article points out, Most women who step out of their careers find expected delights  on  the  home  front,  not  to  mention  the  enormous  relief  of  no  longer worrying about shortchanging their kids. (Wallis, \"The Case for Staying Home\") Motherhood, they find, provides both joy and fulfillment if it is not drowned out by other responsibilities. Alternatively,  the  February  21,  2005,  cover  story  from  Newsweek  chose  to highlight the stressful side of motherhood. In \"The Myth of the Perfect Mother: "}
{"Page": 177, "Info": "Why  It  Drives  Real  Women  Crazy,\"  Judith  Warner  addresses  the  tendency  of many  moms  to  take  responsibility  for  everything  in  their  house  and  home  on themselves. This burden ultimately robs moms of the joys that come with being a wife and mother. Contrary to Newsweek's title, though, \"the perfect mother\" is no myth. There is a magnificent portrait of her in Proverbs 31:10-31. Embodying all the wisdom of the  book  (this  woman  is  a  Jesus  lady!)  that  she  appropriately  concludes,  she places before every woman a standard, a bar, an ideal. Perfection, however, should not be a mother's goal. That would only frustrate and discourage each and every one of us. However, growth in the  direction and likeness of this lovely lady who walks  in  the  wisdom  of  Christ  is  certainly  attainable.  Eight  exemplary  truths present themselves for our careful consideration. She Is Trusted by Her Husband PROVERBS 31:10-12 The opening words of this poem, \"Who can find,\" do not imply \"a capable wife\" does  not  exist.  They  rather  affirm  that  she  does  exist  and  that  she  is  of inestimable worth, she is a treasure, especially to her husband. Two reasons are noted. She Is Virtuous (31:10) \"Noble\" is translated elsewhere as strong, wealthy, able, and valiant. This lady is \"capable\" (GNT) and a woman of \"excellence\" (NASB). She is \"precious,\" and the man who finds such a woman is blessed. Indeed, she is a treasure worth far more than jewels (cf. 3:15; 8:11). She Is Valuable (31:11-12) Her husband's heart-who he really is on the inside -safely \"trusts in her.\" He harbors no doubts or suspicions, questions or concerns. He has full confidence in her because of her competence and character. Proverbs specifies her adeptness at managing family finances and necessities. She knows what her man and her family need, and she will see that they have it. \"He [and they] will not lack anything good.\" Verse 12 is remarkable. She will be a blessing to her husband all the days of her  life.  If  he  should  precede  her  in  death,  he  does  not  fear  what  she  will  say when he is gone. In life and in death, he is confident she will do him good. Several other proverbs speak to the blessing of having a good wife. Proverbs 12:4  says,  \"A  wife  of  noble  character  is  her  husband's  crown,  but  a  wife  who causes shame is like rottenness in his bones.\" Proverbs 18:22 says, \"A man who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.\" And Proverbs "}
{"Page": 178, "Info": "19:14 says, \"A house and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.\" The man who finds such a wife will reap the blessings of her precious character as long as she is living to bless him. \"Her commitment to her husband's well-being is true, not false; constant, not temperamental; reliable, not fickle; and discerning\" (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 522). She Is a Hard Worker PROVERBS 31:13-19 This  lady  is  a  fountain  of  energy.  Her  husband,  as  the  spiritual  leader  of  the home, may be the coach. She, however, is clearly the quarterback. She calls the plays,  sets  the  players  in  the  proper  place,  and  executes  the  game  plan  to perfection. She may even call an audible from time to time! She Uses Her Hands (31:13-15) In verse 13 she takes care of the family's clothing. In verse 14 she takes care of the family's food, sailing out and returning daily \"like the merchant ships,\" bringing what they need. And in verse 15 she takes care of the family's schedule, rising before sunrise if necessary to provide food for her whole household. She Uses Her Head (31:16-19) Using her home as a base of operation, she is business savvy (v. 16). \"There is no foolish purchasing or indebtedness here\" (Ross, \"Proverbs,\" 248). Further, she is strong not weak, vigorous not anemic (v. 17). She has an air of confidence as well as fairness, and she is devoted to excellence (v. 18). She wisely conducts her business, heeding the warning of the Russian proverb that says, \"There are two fools in the market. One asks too much and one asks too little.\" If necessary she will work late into the night to make sure the job gets done. She does what she can with what she has without complaint or self-pity (v. 19). "}
{"Page": 179, "Info": "She Is Compassionate PROVERBS 31:20 This lady is tender in heart and conscience toward those less fortunate than she. A  generous  and  gracious  spirit  characterizes  her  life.  \"She  uses  her  industry  in charitable ways\" (Ross, \"Proverbs,\" 249). In this one verse we see two aspects of her  compassion.  First,  she  helps  the  poor.  The  Proverbs  lady  does  not  become  so busy  with  her  home  that  she  cannot  see  the  hurt  of  others.  In  this  she  is  very much like Jesus, the embodiment of wisdom. She gladly \"opens her arms to the poor\" (NIV). She meets them where they are and reaches out to hug and help, to aid and assist. Second, she helps the needy. This lady is sensitive to their needs and works to aid them. She embraces the truth of Proverbs 11:25, which teaches, \"The generous man  will  be  prosperous\"  (NASB).  This  woman  treats  her  advantages  not  as  an occasion for self-indulgence but as an opportunity to be a blessing to others. She Is Ready for Tough Times PROVERBS 31:21-22 Life  has  its  ups  and  downs,  its  good  times  and  its  bad  times.  The  virtuous woman is well aware of this, and she is prepared to face both. When the difficult days confront her, she goes into action. But rather than flailing about erratically, she moves in a very definite manner. First She Takes Care of Others (31:21) When cold weather comes, she sees that her family is ready, clothed with the finest quality garments she can provide (scarlet according to the Masoretic Text, or double according to the Septuagint). When tough times come, she does not lower the bar. She does her best and begins by looking out for the interest of others (cf. Phil 2:4). Then She Takes Care of Herself (31:22) The text would indicate this woman was a woman of means. Because of her character and commitments, God could entrust her with material blessings, knowing she will not hoard them but will share them. Working with her own hands, she uses the finest fabrics and highest quality materials available to her. She is strong and elegant, gracious and attractive. Her outward apparel only enhances the radiant beauty that shines forth from her heart and soul. She Is a Blessing to Her Husband "}

What is this marvelous mother like? What does this wonderful wife do? First, she is active with her hands (v. 24). She makes clothing and furnishings for herself and her family, making enough to sell the excess for profit. Second, she is adorned by her character (v. 25). What she wears is always in style: strength and honor, as well as a sense of humor and a positive outlook. Third, she is appropriate in her speech (v. 26).

She keeps her eyes wide open, watching each member of the family, sensitive to their personalities, conscious of their needs, quick to spot danger.

{"Page": 185, "Info": "Her Children Bless Her (31:28) The children of this mother stand to their feet and bless her. They testify to her impact on their lives and her influence that still shapes and guides them. One of the all-time greats as a mother was Susannah Wesley, mother of Charles and John. Mother to seventeen children, she prayed one hour each day just for them, and she spent one hour each week discussing spiritual matters with each one individually. Her children, no doubt, called her blessed. Why? Here are a few of the rules she used in raising her children. At the time, they may have seemed harsh. Later, her children saw the wisdom of them and blessed her for loving them in such clear and tangible ways. 1.  Eating between meals not allowed. 2.  All children they are to be in bed by 8 p.m. 3.  They are required to take medicine without complaining. 4.  Subdue  self-will  in  a  child,  and  those  working  together  with  God  to save the child's soul. 5.  Teach a child to pray as soon as he can speak. 6.  Require all to be still during Family Worship. 7.  Give  them  nothing  that  they  cry  for,  and  only  that  when  asked  for politely. 8.  Prevent lying; punish no fault which is first confessed and repented of. 9.  Never allow a sinful act to go unpunished. 10.  Never punish a child twice for a single offense. 11.  Comment and reward good behavior. 12.  Any  attempt  to  please,  even  if  poorly  performed,  should  be commended. 13.  Preserve property rights, even in smallest matters. 14.  Strictly observe all promises. 15.  Require no daughter to work before she can read well. 16.  Teach children to fear the rod. (\"16 House Rules\") Any  child  would  be  blessed  to  be  loved  by  a  mother  in  such  an  intentional manner. As they grow to become parents themselves, they will bless her for how she raised them and what she taught them. Her Husband Praises Her (31:28-29) Ross wisely notes, \"The wisdom of the noble woman inspires praise from her family-from those who know her the "}
{"Page": 186, "Info": "best\" (\"Proverbs,\" 251). Joining the chorus of his children, her husband complements their chant-\"We have the greatest mother in the world\"-with one of his own: \"I have the greatest wife in the world.\" I strongly suspect the children learned to praise Mom by watching Dad. They had learned it from him. I (Danny) have often said to my sons that I made one mistake in marrying their mother when I was twenty-one and she was nineteen. I should have married her when I was twenty and she was eighteen! That would have added an extra year of my being married to the greatest wife in the world as I see it! Now that my sons are grown, they joyfully join me in praising and admiring the godly wife and mother the Lord has given us. She Is Honored by the Lord PROVERBS 31:30-31 The  tribute  to  this  incredible  woman  ends  as  it  should:  with  an  eternal perspective  and  praise  from  the  Lord.  It  seems  best  to  me  to  see  God  as  the speaker through the sage in verses 30-31. She Has Godly Perspective (31:30) Charm and beauty are not bad; they simply are not what makes a great woman. \"Inner spiritual beauty does not deceive\" (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 535). Physical  appearance  is  fleeting;  it  does  not  endure.  To  trust  in  and  focus  on these  temporary  advantages  is  foolish  and  self-deceiving.  The  virtuous  woman knows what matters, she knows what lasts, she knows what is eternal. These are the things she values. As one who belongs to Jesus, she seeks the things above. She also sets her mind on things above because her \"life is hidden with Christ in God\"  (Col  3:1-3).  Having  entered  into  a  relationship  with  Wisdom  himself, Jesus  Christ,  she  fears  the  Lord,  which  \"is  the  beginning  of  knowledge\"  (Prov 1:7). She Receives Godly Praise (31:30-31) What matters is that this lady knows the Lord, loves the Lord, and fears the Lord. Her passion in life is to please him, know him, obey him, and honor him. Such a woman will receive praise (in v. 30 it is implied the praise come from the Lord), and the life she lives day in and day out will be fruitful and worthy of praise (v. 31). At the end of life, looking back over the many years of service for God and service to others, she will quietly and confidently say, \"No regrets. No regrets.\" "}
{"Page": 187, "Info": "Conclusion Proverbs  begins  with  a  dad  telling  his  son  to  make  Woman  Wisdom  his  wife, and  it  ends  with  a  husband  praising  a  wise  wife.  Woman  Wisdom  points  to Jesus, who is the embodiment of God's Wisdom. The wise wife is, therefore, a type  of  Woman  Wisdom,  and  one  can  only  be  that  kind  of  wife  if  she  is  in  a relationship with the Wisdom of God who is Jesus Christ. The only way to be a positive mom and a Proverbs lady is to be a saved mom, a born again woman of God. The woman of Proverbs 31 is not just any woman. She is a saved woman, a godly woman, a  Bible woman, a Jesus woman. The applause and praise of the world  mean  nothing.  The  applause  and  praise  of  the  Lord  Jesus  means everything.  She  walks  in  wisdom  as  the  personification  of  Lady  Wisdom because  she  knows  that  the  ultimate  incarnation  of  wisdom  is  the  Wisdom  of God, Jesus Christ (see 1 Cor 1:30).

II. Give Your Children Parents Who Are Following Jesus (24:3-4; 19:13). III. Give Your Children Training in Wisdom. A. Example (14:26) B. Instruction (24:3-4) C. Correction (13:24; 23:13-14; 29:15) S tan  Toussaint  was  a  much-loved  professor  at  Dallas  Theological  Seminary for  forty-seven  years.  He  loves  the  Bible.  He  also  loves  the  family.  In  an article titled, \"Building a Happy Home,\" Toussaint addresses the importance of priorities in family life. He highlights six: 1.  Persons before things 2.  Home before occupation 3.  Partner before children 4.  Children before friends 5.  Partner before self 6.  Spiritual before material He concludes his article by saying, \"Priorities are indeed peculiar. But they are essential.  And  they'll  go  a  long  way  toward  producing  a  strong,  biblical,  and happy home\" (Kindred Spirit, date unknown). Unfortunately, what Stan describes is absent in many homes today. That deficiency is multiplied throughout our country. There are lots of homes today  that  are  dominated  by  tension  and  unhappiness.  Even  though  the inhabitants have a lot in worldly terms, they walk on eggshells around each other and  are  not  enjoying  life.  It  could  be  that  the  parents  are  workaholics  who  are never  around,  the  wife  constantly  nags  the  husband,  the  husband  and  wife constantly bicker in front of the children, or the husband loses his temper easily. "}
{"Page": 190, "Info": "There  are  so  many  broken  and  unhappy  homes,  which  raises  an  important question: \"If the American Dream does not produce a happy home, how do you get a happy home?\" Where are you going to find it? Are you going to look to the world?  The  world  says  that  we  should  let  children  basically  raise  themselves, give them what they want, be their buddy, forgo rules, let them make their own choices,  avoid  spanking  them,  and  leave  their  raising  to  daycares  and  schools. How has that worked out? We  need  to  look  to  the  Word  of  God.  It  says  that  wisdom  is  the  path  to  a happy home. Repeatedly, Proverbs says that God actively blesses wise families with happiness (10:1; 17:21; 23:15-16,24; 28:7; 29:3). And God actively curses the foolish family with sorrow by handing them over to what they want. So let's look  to  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs  and  see  the  path  to  a  happy  home.  Proverbs 24:3-4 says, \"A house is built by wisdom, and it is established by understanding; by knowledge the rooms are filled with every precious and beautiful treasure.\" Give Your Children Yourself More Than Your Money PROVERBS 24:3-4; 15:1-17; 17:1 Proverbs  24:3-4  says  that  the  means  to  building,  establishing,  and  enriching  a household  is  wisdom.  Many  think  this  is  not  about  literal  money  but  rather  a wealth  of  stable family  relationships!  (Garrett,  Proverbs,  198).  This truth  is  huge because one of children's major needs is family security. Both  options  could  be  true-wisdom  is  the  path  to  a  loving  family  and legitimate  wealth.  After  all,  Proverbs  gives  a  balanced  view  of  money.  It  does not give an unqualified endorsement of money; rather, it says both positive and negative things about money. Money gained through wisdom is good. According to Proverbs, it is good to be content, to be generous, to provide for your family, to save, and to leave an inheritance. On the other hand, money can become an idol  that  costs  you  your  family.  Money  is  only  good  in  the  proper  context  of contentedly enjoying it in a happy family! Proverbs says that if the choice you have is between a happy home and a wealthy home, choose a happy home every day  of  the  week  (Longman,  Proverbs,  318).  A  happy,  loving  home  rooted  in biblical wisdom is much better than a wealthy home with tension! Proverbs says this repeatedly. Proverbs 15:16-17 says, \"Better a little with the fear  of  the  LORD  than  great  treasure  with  turmoil.  Better  a  meal  of  vegetables where  there  is  love  than  a  fattened  ox  with  hatred.\"  And  Proverbs  17:1  says, "}
{"Page": 191, "Info": "\"Better a dry crust with peace than a house full of feasting with strife.\" The so- called  Better  Than  sayings  modify  conventional  wisdom  (Van  Leeuwen, \"Wealth and Poverty,\" 29; Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 1-15, 108). Yes, Proverbs says that  money  can  be  a  good  thing,  but  not  at  any  price!  The  fear  of  the  Lord  is better than money, and so is a harmonious home. Solomon paints a vivid picture. Greens and crusty bread with no olive oil to dip it in is better than filet mignon in a home with tension where you walk on eggshells! How can veggies be better than steak? If you eat them in a happy and loving home! The  application  seems  clear:  spend  more  energy  loving  your  children  and spending  time  with  them  than  making  money  for  them.  I  (  Jon)  remember counseling  with  a  young  husband  and  father  who  was  about  to  lose  his  family because  he  worked  all  the  time.  His  statement  to  me  was,  \"Well,  I  make  the money and she raises the kids.\" I think many men have that mindset. Yes, you are  called  to  provide  (1  Tim  5:8)  but  not  at  the  expense  of  the  parenting  task. Your  children  need  you.  They  need  two  parents.  I  have  never  counseled  with anyone who says, \"I was miserable as a child because my parents spent way too much  time  with  me.\"  But  I  have  counseled  the  opposite  many  times.  So  make quality time for your children. Go to their games and recitals, help bathe them, read  the  Bible  and  say  prayers  before  bed,  talk  with  them  throughout  the  day, and be an active part of their lives. I am so thankful for a father who modeled this for me and made sure to put our ball games on his calendar so he would not miss them. He built a happy home! There is a greater possession than money, and it is a godly life that fears the Lord and builds a loving home. Through wisdom, you build a happy home rather than a rich one by the world's standards. The picture painted in Proverbs 17:1 is of a family who is outwardly religious-putting on a show for the public when celebrating  the  festivals-but  on  the  inside  things  are  awful  (Waltke,  Proverbs, Chapters  15-31,  39).  Their  so-called  spirituality  has  not  affected  their  daily  life  in the home. It's a fake spirituality. If your Christianity does not shape the way you parent your children and order your home, it is not real Christianity. That leads to  the  next  wisdom  principle  for  building  a  happy  home.  How  do  you  wisely build a happy home? Give Your Children Parents Who Are Following Jesus PROVERBS 24:3-4; 19:13 "}
{"Page": 192, "Info": "Again, Proverbs 24:3 says that the means to building and establishing a home is wisdom. That makes perfect sense in light of the full context of Proverbs. God created and ordered the world through wisdom (Prov 3; 8).35 But Proverbs has also  told  us  that  wisdom  is  not  a  thing;  Wisdom  is  a  person-the  co-Creator Jesus! Since God created the world and it works in a certain divine way, we need to  pattern  our  homes  after  the  order  by  which  God  created  the  world.  Going against the grain is foolishness. Follow the pattern of creation to establish your home,  but  remember  that  pattern  centers  on  a  person-Jesus  of  Nazareth. Wisdom  is  a  person  to  know,  and  once  you  begin  a  relationship  with  him,  he makes you wise for daily life. God built the world through Wisdom, and we are to build our homes through him as well! God created the world through Wisdom, which means order and harmony with God, each other, and the world around us. Tragically, that harmony was broken through  sin  and  foolishness,  so  now  there  is  disharmony.  You  can  look  at  the first family in Eden to see that tension (Gen 3-4)! Proverbs tells us that Wisdom is  the  path  to  reestablishing  that  order  and  harmony  in  our  families,  living  life the way it was meant to be lived-as God intended-because the world works a certain  way.  Admittedly,  it  does  not  always  work  out  immediately  in  a  fallen world,  but  it  will  work  out  ultimately.  According  to  Proverbs,  this  pattern  is  a person to embrace through the fear of the Lord. Proverbs 8 presents Wisdom ( Jesus,  according  to  1  Cor  1:30)  as  the  mediator  that  reconciles  humankind  to God and to each other. So a right relationship with God through Christ will lead to  right  relationships  with  others,  including  your  family.  If  there  is  a  lack  of harmony in your home, it's because there is a problem with Jesus. We need to be conformed to the image of Christ, who brings many sons to glory (Heb 2). Proverbs  19:13  reveals  how  foolishness  can  lead  to  parental  or  marital relationships  that  are  out  of  whack.  \"A  foolish  son  is  his  father's  ruin,  and  a wife's  nagging  is  an  endless  dripping.\"  This  foolishness  exposes  the  fact  that your relationship with Christ is lacking in some way. You can spend three hours in  prayer  daily  and  go  to  four  Bible  studies  weekly;  but  if  your  home  is  filled with tension, it shows a problem with Jesus. Many seemingly pious people who are very involved in the church have family lives that are a wreck. It should not be  this  way.  Repentance,  confession,  and  pursuing  Christ  are  the  ways  to  get things back on track. Even confessing to your children that you are a sinner in need of Christ can go a long way! If you want to have harmony in the home, it starts with embracing Jesus. Your children  need  parents  who  have  vibrant  relationships  with  Jesus  and  his  body, "}

If you are in harmony with Jesus, he will then lead you to harmony in your relationships. Give Your Children Training in Wisdom How  do  we  build  a  home  by  wisdom?  How  can  we  train  our  children  in wisdom? Example (14:26) It starts with your example. Your children need to see a saved parent who walks in wisdom. Psalms 127 and 128 echo these important themes we see in Proverbs. Your children need to see you pray, read Scripture, attend church, sing the songs with a good attitude, listen to the sermons, and serve in the church. In the home, they need to see that you have a hard work ethic, but they also need to see you prioritize time with them and your spouse. They need to see you love well your spouse. Proverbs 14:26 says, \"In the fear of the LORD one has strong confidence and his children have a refuge.\" Those who trust the Lord live securely because they are  under  God's  protection  from  the  storms  of  life.  The  same  is  true  for  our children! Your wisdom shields your children because they get to experience the benefits  and  blessings  of  it-their  lives  are  affected  by  your  actions.  But  also, the  wise  parents,  by  virtue  of  their  example  and  teaching,  pass  wisdom  on  to their  children.  Proverbs  20:7  teaches  something  very  similar:  \"A  righteous person  acts  with  integrity;  his  children  who  come  after  him  will  be  happy.\" Therefore, the ones who model wisdom will pass it and its benefits on to their children. Why is this so? This is true because children usually turn out to be like their parents.  That  is  both  a  challenging  and  a  frightening  reality.  And  children  are excellent hypocrisy detectors. My ( Jon's) kids used to call me out all the time for  my  hypocrisy  in  using  the  \"S\"  word,  when  I  told  them  not  to  use  it.  They would  say,  \"Dad,  you  just  said  \u2018stupid'!\"  Children  watch  you  closely,  and  you have  tremendous  influence  on  their  lives.  Granted,  you  cannot  conclude  that every foolish child is unwise because his or her parents messed up, but generally that is the way it works. So what example are you setting for your children? If they turned out like you, would that be a good thing? Chances are that they will! Instruction (24:3-4) "}
{"Page": 194, "Info": "The second way to train your children in wisdom is to instruct them. You must use your words to teach your children. There should be none of this \"preach the gospel at all times and when necessary use words.\" No! Your wise example must also include wise words of instruction. This truth is one of the major concerns of Proverbs.  It  is  all  over  the  book.  It  is  a  dad  following  the  commands  of Deuteronomy 6 to teach his son, and pleading with him, \"Listen to me!\" Teach your children the wisdom of Proverbs. That means teaching them right from  wrong.  That  means  teaching  them  spiritual  realities  as  well  as  practical realities like a work ethic, saving money, and controlling their tongues, because there is no sacred/secular divide. God is concerned with every detail of your life. Teach your children the way that life works best. Do not just teach your children what to do; teach them why they must do it. The \"why\" is the motivation for the behavior. Solomon constantly tells his son the consequences or benefits of walking in wisdom or walking in folly. He says if  you  do  not  do  this  or  you  do  not  listen  to  that,  there  are  disastrous  results. Teach  your  children  why  they  should  do  their  chores,  handle  money  correctly, control  their  tongues,  and  develop  conflict  resolution  and  wise  planning  skills. Lay out both the benefits and the consequences. Teach them why it is a bad idea to buck authority, be too lazy to do their homework, be cocky, gossip, or have sex before marriage. For  example,  my  (  Jon's)  parents  would  not  allow  me  to  quit  track  in  the eighth grade because they wanted me to learn to finish what I started. That was the reason. And there are so many things I would not have gotten through if they had not taught me that lesson-like my PhD! You  must  be  the  teacher  and  authority  in  their  lives  on  these  matters.  You must  not  have  just  \"the  talk,\"  but  ongoing  talks  about  dating,  romance,  and sexuality. If you are not the authority, their peers or the TV will be, and that is a bad idea. This is your role; you can't farm it out to daycares, schools, or youth pastors. You are responsible to get them on the right path because they cannot choose it by themselves. This  also  includes  teaching  them  the  Bible.  Do  not  hide  behind  excuses  like \"That's  just  not  my  thing.\"  Make  it  your  thing!  Read  the  Bible  to  them,  share your testimony with them, talk to them in the car on the way home from church about the Lord's Supper, and help them memorize Scripture. You can do it. You memorize meaningless sports facts and movie quotes, so determine to memorize God's Word. It has never been easier. My daughters and I listen to the AWANA "}
{"Page": 195, "Info": "CD with memory verses on the way to school. There are free audio Bible apps for your smartphone. Take advantage of the resources! Finally, this also means being alert for conversations. When your children ask questions, even questions that might make you uncomfortable (How can I get to heaven? Is it wrong to be gay? What is sex?), don't shut them down or put them off.  That  will  just  teach  them  not  to  come  to  you  with  things  that  concern  or interest  them.  Answer  their  questions  kindly  and  directly  in  an  age  appropriate way. If you are not sure how to do that, just say, \"That's a great question. Can I have  some  time  to  think  about  it  and  talk  with  you  soon  about  it?\"  Don't  be afraid to seek counsel from older, godly parents. But when your children want to talk, make every effort to make the most of the opportunity. Correction (13:24; 23:13-14; 29:15) The  third  way  to  train  your  children  in  wisdom  is  to  correct  them.  You  do  not punish your children simply for the sake of punishing them. Discipline is about correction-putting them on the right path (29:15). That means instruction must accompany discipline. Some  people  falsely  think,  \"I  just  love  my  children  too  much  to  discipline them.\" However, if you do not discipline your children, it is because you do not really  love  them.  In  fact,  Proverbs  says  that  you  hate  them  (13:24).  When  my dad (Danny) was in high school, he was hanging out at a restaurant with some buddies  when  the  subject  of  curfew  came  up.  All  the  teenage  guys  reluctantly told when their curfew was, but one of the guys said, \"I don't have a curfew.\" His friends were incredulous. \"How can that be? You are so lucky!\" But my dad said his countenance changed, and he said, \"My old man doesn't care if I ever come home.\" The lack of boundaries did not show love; rather, it sadly showed indifference. We  must  correct  our  kids  because  discipline  is  an  evangelism  mission  to rescue  our  kids  from  hell.  Proverbs  23:13-14  says,  \"Don't  withhold  discipline from a youth; if you punish him with a rod, he will not die. Punish him with a rod, and you will rescue his life from Sheol.\" Kids are sinful at heart, and left to themselves they will walk to destruction. It is not loving to be their buddy and let them  make  their  own  choices  as  they  march  off  toward  hell.  You  must  start young with discipline. There is a temptation to give in during the early years for the sake of peace, but you must fight against that temptation. Correction  is  a  gospel  issue.  You  teach  them  what  sin  is,  that  it  has consequences, that they will be held accountable, and that it needs to be repented "}
{"Page": 196, "Info": "of. If you do not correct them, they will start to think that evil is good. How  do  you  correct  them?  Well,  Proverbs  clearly  calls  for  spanking.  If  that upsets you, send your e-mails to Solomon not us because it is all over Proverbs, no matter how out of step with the culture it might seem. We all understand this principle when it comes to working out. You discipline your body-introducing a little pain-in order to make it healthier. The same is true with spanking. It is not detrimental if done properly. In fact there are studies that show adults who were spanked as children have a sunnier outlook on life and are more successful (Baklinski, \"Young Children\"). You should never spank out of anger or because the  child  simply  is  not  doing  what  you  want  them  to  do-that's  called  abuse. You  should  not  spank  for  childish  accidents  like  spilling  milk.  But  you  should spank for outright defiance, dishonesty, or rebellion. Do it in private so as not to embarrass your child and so you can talk-have a teachable moment. This is an  important  moment for  a gospel conversation.  Tell them what  they did  or  did  not  do.  Secure  an  acknowledgement  that  they  know  why  they  are getting a spanking. That can teach them confession. Tell them you love them no matter  what,  and  that  your  love  for  them  is  not  determined  by  their  behavior. Hug them afterward and tell them that you are a sinner too who understands the need for forgiveness. That is why you are thankful for Jesus because you have done  similar  things  to  what  they  just  did,  and  you  are  glad  Jesus  has  forgiven you.  Spanking  should  wait  until  the  child  is  old  enough  to  understand expectations and can start responding to directions. Proverbs  also  seems  to  call  for  an  adjustment  of  correction  as  the  child  gets older. Proverb 29:15 states, \"The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother\" (ESV). As the child gets older, a rebuke (or restriction) should be enough to correct the behavior. Words are always part of the correction process. Finally, here is some practical advice: Make sure that you and your spouse are on the same page when it comes to correction so that your children cannot play one  against  another.  Give  a  big  playing  field  and  don't  be  too  legalistic, otherwise you won't be consistent in your discipline, and you have to be! "}

W e've all heard the old saying, \"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\" That statement is not true, and we all know it. Physical  wounds  often  heal  long  before  emotional  ones.  There  are  words  that still haunt you. When you hear them, your stomach turns. Or there are words that you really regret saying and wish you could have back. Words  are  powerful.  Words  like  \"I  hate  you\"  or  \"I  love  you\"  or  \"You  will never amount to anything\" or \"I'm so proud of you\" change lives! Words change history. Words like  \"I have a  dream\" or \"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall\" shape  the  course  of  history.  Words  can  shape  the  course  of  eternity:  \"For  God loved the world in this way: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes  in  him  will  not  perish  but  have  eternal  life\"  (  John  3:16);  \"If  you confess  with  your  mouth,  \u2018Jesus  is  Lord,'  and  believe  in  your  heart  that  God raised him from the dead, you will be saved\" (Rom 10:9). The tongue holds the power of life and death (Prov 18:21). The problem is that while our tongues contain this power, we often cannot control them. We try to, but we just cannot. A lack of self-control when it comes to our tongues destroys marriages, families, and friendships.

As  James  the  brother  of  Jesus  incredulously  observes,  with  our  tongues  we bless God and curse men made in his image ( Jas 3:9). Solomon understands the harmful power of our words, and he warns us about them repeatedly. We know this, and we do not really need to be convinced. Who among us has not thought at  one  time,  \"I  really  wish  I  had  not  said  that\"?  We  all  struggle  with  using harmful  words  that  hurt  us,  our  relationships  with  others,  and  our  relationship with  God.  Let's  look  at  what  Proverbs  says  about  harmful  words  and  see  if change is possible. Don't Use Harmful Words PROVERBS 26:18-28 Proverbs describes numerous kinds of harmful words, and it includes a lot more than  just  cursing.  There  are  ways  to  talk  and  use  our  words  that  are  very destructive. Let's examine what Proverbs says. Contentious Speech (26:21) Proverbs  talks  about  contentious  or  quarrelsome  speech.  Proverbs  26:21  says, \"As  charcoal  for  embers  and  wood  for  fire,  so  is  a  quarrelsome  person  for kindling  strife.\"  Contentious  speech  is  speech  that  loves  to  stir  up  conflict.  It loves to argue and disagree. It thinks that it is cool to constantly criticize things. The argument can be on any topic under the sun. The contentious person loves to argue about sports, sitcoms, the Bible, or politics. They usually start their end of a conversation with, \"Well, actually that is not the case . . .\" You can find this guy commenting on Facebook a lot! Unfortunately,  you  also  frequently  see  this  in  churches:  folks  who  like  to complain about what other people wear or grumble if they do not get their way. Nothing  seems  to  be  to  their  liking.  They  love  to  spread  dissension  and  stir trouble  in  an  attempt  to  get  what  they  want.  They  even  make  ultimatums  and threats  like,  \"If  things  do  not  change  around  here,  I  will  just  have  to  leave  the church.\" Perverse Speech (2:12; 4:24; 15:4; 24:24; 30:20) Wisdom  is  meant  to  deliver  us  from  perverse  or  devious  speech  (2:12;  4:24; 15:4). Perverse speech is speech that distorts truth and reality.36 Proverbs talks extensively  about  this.  Perverse  speech  is  not  the  same  thing  as  deception  (see "}
{"Page": 202, "Info": "below).  Perverse  speech  distorts  truth  itself.  The  person  using  it  may-and probably does-think that what they are saying is true. Perverse speech would include false religions and false ideas. False religions tell  you  distortions  like,  if  you  kill  infidels,  you  will  get  numerous  virgins  in paradise. Or if you just believe in Jesus, he will make you healthy and wealthy. The  category  of  perverse  speech  would  also  include  speech  that  calls  sin  a good thing. That claim leads people astray. Proverbs 24:24 says, \"Whoever says to  the  guilty,  \u2018You  are  innocent'-peoples  will  curse  him,  and  nations  will denounce him.\" Calling a sin something other than sin is perverse. Many in our culture  want  to  do  this  with  things  like  homosexuality,  and  even  in  the  church people are waffling on whether or not it is a sin. But we do the same thing when we minimize divorce, gluttony, gossiping, or self-righteousness. It is perverse to call sin anything other than what it is. Perverse  speech  also  includes  the  justification  of  sin.  Proverbs  30:20  says, \"This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u2018I've done nothing wrong.'\" We can act like our sin is not sin, or we can justify it like it is not that big a deal. Perverse speech justifies our way of life (Garrett, Proverbs, 76). This might manifest itself as a lady justifying living with her boyfriend or a man  justifying  his  divorce.  With  our  mouths  we  can  rationalize  and  minimize and excuse our sin. Why do we talk like this? We do it because we want to live how we want to live. We want to avoid repentance. We want to live life on our terms and still be able to say, \"I am a good person.\" Instead of trusting Jesus to justify us, we want to prove ourselves right! Flattery (26:28) Proverbs  26:28  says,  \"A  lying  tongue  hates  those  it  crushes,  and  a  flattering mouth  causes  ruin.\"  Flattery  is  smooth  talk  (Goldsworthy,  Tree  of  Life,  168). Proverbs  condemns  flirting  with  or  praising  others  the circumstances for your advantage. to  manipulate  Flattery  can  be  deception  (Goldsworthy,  Tree  of  Life,  168).  Flattery  can  be exaggerating  the  truth  to  elicit  a  reaction  from  someone  who  will  gratify  you. Yes,  this  includes  flirting,  but  it  can  also  be  any  situation  where  you  praise another so that they like you or respond the way you want. Flattery is a form of manipulation to advance yourself. It's not a genuine compliment. Proverbs 7:21 says, \"She seduces him with her persistent pleading; she lures with her flattering talk.\" So flattery can be flirting or flirting back with someone "}
{"Page": 203, "Info": "at  work,  at  your  children's  ballgame,  in  chat  rooms,  or  by  text  messages. According to Proverbs, flattery is the number-one factor in cheating. Flattery and listening to flattery pulls your heart away from your spouse. I read the testimony of a pastor who fell morally, and he said it started with flattery. It was fun to him at  first,  and  then  he  let  it  linger  too  long.  He  began  to  rationalize  what  he  was doing because he was frustrated and thought there was not really any harm in it. He  thought  it  was  not  a  big  deal  and  that  he  would  not  really  do  anything anyway. Then, all of a sudden, he ended up cheating on his wife! It all started with flattery. Be warned. Flattery also happens outside of romantic relationships. People are obsequious to others who they think can advance them. People tell others what they want to hear.  Why?  They  want  admiration,  self-advancement,  or  some  other  desired outcome. Proverbs condemns this kind of speech. Deception (26:18-19) Proverbs 26:18-19 says, \"Like a madman who throws flaming darts and deadly arrows,  so  is  the  person  who  deceives  his  neighbor  and  says,  \u2018I  was  only joking!'\"  Deception  can  be  embellishment,  exaggeration,  half-truths,  omission, intentional  misrepresentation,  truth  in  jest,  or  perjury.  Verse  19  mentions  the truth in jesting. You hurt someone's feelings, so you say, \"I was just joking,\" in order to minimize their pain, but really you meant it. We  can  use  our  words  to  construct  false  realities.  Pro  athletes  caught  using performance-enhancing  drugs  try  to  convince  people,  \"I  would  never  do something  like  that.\"  I  (  Jon)  remember  a  new  kid  coming  to  our  high  school, and  his  dad  tried  to  convince  our  basketball  coach  that  the  University  of Kentucky was recruiting him because he was such a stud athlete. The kid could barely make the junior varsity team, but his dad tried to convince people he was an all-star. All of us do this kind of thing. Who has not exaggerated or left details out to come off looking better? We are born deceivers. Children do it to avoid trouble or to get out of trouble. Even when we tell our children, \"If you tell me the truth, you  won't  get  in  trouble,\"  our  children  still  struggle  to  come  clean.  Teenagers are  deceivers.  They  cheat  in  school  to  get  good  grades,  and  they  lie  to  their parents about where they are going. Adults are deceivers. They lie to their boss about being sick so they can stay home. They hide things from their spouse or omit things to keep the serenity in marriage. In conversations, adults will put the blame on someone else, even when it is their fault, so that their spouse is mad at "}
{"Page": 204, "Info": "someone else rather than at them. Adults can exaggerate the truth to avoid doing something they do not want to do. Or adults will tell part of the truth so that they can  say  to  themselves,  \"Well,  technically  I  didn't  lie.\"  They  are  still  trying  to manipulate the outcome. Why  do  we  deceive?  We  do  it  because  we  want  something,  and  we  think manipulating the truth will help us get it. This reveals idolatry because it shows we are seeking satisfaction and joy in something other than God. We try to find satisfaction in people's approval, and we value it more than God's approval. Gossip and Slander (11:13) Proverbs  condemns  gossip  and  slander.  Gossip  is  revealing  a  secret,  while slander  is  defaming  people's  reputation  or  mocking  them.  When  it  comes  to gossip,  some  folks  just  love  to  be  in  the  know.  Some  just  cannot  keep  secrets. Proverbs 11:13 says, \"A gossip goes around revealing a secret, but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.\" Ask yourself: can you keep a confidence, or do you regularly start sentences with \"Don't tell anyone else this, but . . .\"? Some even try to disguise their gossip and slander as a prayer request: \"He's really gone off the deep end. We need to pray for him.\" Why do we gossip and slander? We do it for revenge, out of jealousy, or out of the pride of wanting to be in the know. Bragging (27:2) Proverbs condemns bragging. It says, \"Let another praise you, and not your own mouth-a  stranger,  and  not  your  own  lips\"  (27:2).  Do  not  praise  yourself  or embellish  your  accomplishments.  A  modern  paraphrase  of  this  might  be something  like,  \"Let  another  tweet  about  you  and  not  your  own  tweet-a stranger and not your own account!\" So often self-exaltation is seen as good and necessary to get ahead in our culture. Or you know people who always turn the conversation back to themselves no matter what you say. Toby Keith sings about this  when  he  wants  to  \"talk  about  me.\"  Why  do  we  do  this?  We  do  it  because either we are insecure or we want to exalt ourselves. The gospel can cure both of those  things  because  God's  approval  in  Christ  is  incompatible  with  insecurity, and the humility of Christ in laying down his life for others is antithetical to self- exaltation.

{"Page": 205, "Info": "Harmful Words Hurt Relationships PROVERBS 26:18-19 Walking in foolishness with your words has all kinds of negative consequences, including  destroying  your  relationships.  This  is  pretty  obvious.  Proverbs  17:9 says, \"Whoever conceals an offense promotes love, but whoever gossips about it separates friends.\" Gossip spoils friendships (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31, 50). Those who constantly stir up arguments are annoying to be around. Those who deceive hurt their neighbors (26:18-19). Harmful speech ruins relationships. But it's more than that. It's not just that being a contentious person will cause conflict  and  divide  groups,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  flattery  ruins marriages  and  families,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  deception  ruins friendships  or  careers,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  gossip  divides  friends and  hurts  people's  feelings,  although  it  does.  It's  not  just  that  bragging  makes people nauseated to be around you, although it does. The biggest problem is that harmful  speech  separates  you  from  a  relationship  with  God  and  invites judgment.  All  of  the  temporal  consequences  of  broken  relationships  are  just  a foretaste of hell. Jesus says we will be held accountable for every careless word we utter (Matt 12:36). Verses like Proverbs 10:31 teach us, \"The mouth of the righteous  produces  wisdom,  but  a  perverse  tongue  will  be  cut  out.\"  And  19:9 adds, \"A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies perishes.\" Forgiveness and Change Are Possible in Jesus Jesus never sinned with his mouth. He never harmed anyone with his words. He never let deceit slip from his lips (1 Pet 2:22). He fully lived out Proverbs. And yet he took the final judgment for our harmful speech to provide us forgiveness in  full.  The  one  with  no  deceit  in  his  mouth  died  for  deceivers  like  us.  The humble died for the bragger. The reconciler died for the contentious. To the degree that the truth of the gospel grips you, you will no longer need to lie, gossip, slander, or flirt. You will no longer need to exalt yourself with your words  because  Jesus  gives  grace  to  the  humble.  You  will  not  need  to  justify yourself because in Christ you have already been justified. You will not need to be  slanderous  and  unforgiving  because  Jesus  has  forgiven  you.  You  will  not need to lie to get others' approval because you have the approval of Jesus. "}

II. Speak Before You Listen and Speak More Than You Listen (10:19; 17:27-28). III. Listen to Unwise Counsel (12:5). T here  is  a  hilarious  video  on  YouTube  where  a  man  sings  southern  gospel music in a church auditorium. The man sings a song called \"Looking for a City,\" trying to copy a really talented singer named Brian Free who can raise his voice  to  a  really  high  pitch.  The  man  claims  in  this  video  that  he  is  a  better singer than Brian Free as he begins to sing the song and tries to raise his pitch to higher and higher levels. The song is a cacophonous mess that clearly does not come close to what one might call \"good singing.\" It's hilarious! People are self-deceived. The man on this video is convinced that he is a good singer, but any objective evaluation clearly reveals that he is not. That's not just a problem for him or for singers trying to make it on American Idol. It's a problem for  all  of  us.  We  all  can  convince  ourselves  that  we  are  good  parents,  great spouses,  or  wonderful  employees  without  actually  putting  in  the  work  to  be skilled  at  any  of  these  (Ten  Elshof,  I  Told  Me  So,  1-5).  This  self-deception  will catch  up  to  us  eventually  and  can  cause  more  than  embarrassment.  We  know folks  who  have  lost  their  teaching  positions  because  they  were  convinced  that they  were  great  teachers  and  did  not  need  to  heed  their  evaluations  that  they were  too  abrasive  in  their  interactions  with  students.  We  know  husbands  who have lost their marriages because they do not adequately care for their wives, but they are convinced that their wives are the ones who are deceived! Proverbs says a lot about self-deception and how it ruins us. It calls us not to lean on our own understanding or follow the way that seems right to us. Because left to ourselves we are self-deceived and go the wrong way, we need a wisdom that sees the world as it really is and can guide us to safety. The answer to our "}
{"Page": 209, "Info": "problem  is  wise  instruction  from  the  outside  instead  of  \"following  our  hearts.\" We need wisdom from outside of ourselves so that we do not deceive ourselves, destroy  our  relationships,  and  stumble  our  way  through  the  world.  Solomon began  Proverbs  by  saying  that  wisdom  includes  listening  and  obtaining guidance,  but  fools  reject  wisdom  (1:5,7).  We  read  the  same  thing  in  Proverbs 15:31-33, One who listens to life-giving rebukes will be at home among the wise. Anyone who ignores discipline despises himself, but whoever listens to correction acquires good sense. The fear of the LORD is what wisdom teaches, and humility comes before honor. We are not naturally wise or good at heart, but we think we are, and we head off toward destruction. Therefore, whether or not we can listen to and submit to wise counsel is a life or death matter. So if you want to be a fool and wreck your life, it starts with not listening. How Can I Be a Fool? Don't Listen to Anyone but Yourself PROVERBS 12:15; 15:5,22,31,33 Proverbs  15:31  indicates  that  wisdom  is  listening  to  wise  rebuke,  and  thus foolishness  is  the  opposite:  not  listening  to  a  wise  rebuke!  Wisdom  will  not come unless we listen to wise counsel from outside of us because it is not in us. As  Longman  points  out,  \"Only  the  wise  are  willing  to  admit  mistakes,  change behavior and improve their lives,\" which requires listening to correction (Proverbs, 323). Proverbs  15:22  says,  \"Plans  fail  when  there  is  no  counsel,  but  with  many advisers  they  succeed.\"  We  need  many  advisers  to  avoid  getting  just  one perspective.  We  need  counsel  so  we  can  make  good  decisions  and  successful plans. We need this kind of counsel because we so easily deceive ourselves! Proverbs  12:15  adds,  \"A  fool's  way  is  right  in  his  own  eyes,  but  whoever listens to counsel is wise.\"  The way that seems right leads to death, but if you listen to outside counsel you will be wise. Left to ourselves we do not choose the right path. We see this with our children. They do not naturally share; they have to be made to share. They do not naturally pick up their rooms; they have to be instructed to clean their rooms. "}
{"Page": 210, "Info": "The problem is that very few people admit to not being wise. We all think our assessment of the situation is the correct one-if we did not, we would change our  assessment!  Young  pastors  often  think  they  are  wiser  than  older  pastors. Teens  think  they  are  wiser  than  their  much  more  experienced  parents.  Young people  who  are  dating  and  think  they  are  \"in  love\"  persist  in  their  perspective despite  everyone  who  cares  about  them  telling  them  it's  a  bad  idea.  They  will not listen to anyone, and they act like everyone sees the situation wrongly except them! This warped reality is true for all of us, yet we obliviously persist in the notion \"I see things rightly\" because our hearts are broken by sin and we are not naturally wise. Thus, we need to listen to outside counsel and advice to correct our path. We need to listen to God's Word and consider the counsel of trusted friends. This  is  true  in  so  many  areas  of  our  lives.  The  need  for  children  to  listen  to parents  is  repeated  over  and  over  in  Proverbs.  Proverbs  15:5  states,  \"A  fool despises his father's discipline, but a person who accepts correction is sensible.\" This verse means that children should listen to what their parents say and obey them while they live under their roof. It also means that they should seek counsel from  their  parents  when  they  no  longer  live  in  the  same  house!  The  Bible indicates  that  church  members  should  hear  and  obey  their  leaders  who  speak God's word to them (Heb 13:7,17). The Bible exhorts younger people to listen to the counsel of the elderly (Titus 2:4). Consequently, younger parents should seek counsel from older parents who are further along in the parenting task. Younger husbands  should  seek  counsel  from  older  husbands  on  how  to  handle  money, interview for a job, or lead their families. Proverbs  15:33  explains  that  listening  requires  a  posture  of  humility.  Instead of  \"I  did  it  my  way,\"  recognize  that  you  do  not  have  everything  figured  out. Why  does  it  require  humility?  We  are  prideful  and  do  not  naturally  submit ourselves  to  other  people's  advice  if  it  does  not  match  up  with  what  we  think. Our  sinful  reaction  is  immediately  to  think,  \"I  know  better  than  you!\"  In  our culture people are rarely corrected, and even if we are corrected in love, our first reaction is usually not to thank people for their concern. Rather, we bristle, get mad, and think of reasons why they are not fit to talk to us about this situation. Wisdom is the humility to recognize you do not know everything and to ask for counsel. In  concert  with  the  humility  to  listen,  Solomon  teaches  that  wisdom  is ultimately trust and dependence on Yahweh. Whether or not you depend on the Lord  is  revealed  in  whether  or  not  you  listen  to  counsel.  Whether  or  not  you "}
{"Page": 211, "Info": "submit  to  truth  and  authority  in  all  the  areas  of  your  life  reveals  what  your relationship is like with the Lord. It is hard to humble ourselves and submit to the Lord's authority, and that is shown in the fact that it is hard for us to submit to  our  earthly  authorities  like  parents,  government  officials,  bosses,  or  even pastors. It is hard because we think that our way is right. Wisdom requires the ability to recognize that you can deceive yourself, you are not always right, and you need to submit humbly to wise instruction as you submit to the Lord! So do you want to be a fool? Then do not listen to anyone but yourself. Only take  your  own  ideas.  Be  convinced  that  you  are  the  only  one  who  is  right  and that you are smarter than everyone else. No one else is looking out for you and wants your best interest like you do. So listen to yourself, not others! Speak Before You Listen and Speak More Than You Listen PROVERBS 10:19; 17:27-28 Proverbs  talks  a  lot  about  the  use  of  our  tongues,  and  one  key  exhortation  is, \"Don't  talk  so  much!\"  Some  people  really  struggle  with  talking  too  much.  I  ( Jon)  confess that I  am one of them. I often try to finish my wife's  thoughts or jump into the conversation in the middle of her sentence. If you are the kind of person  who  always  wants  to  give  your  opinion  first,  or  if  you  are  not  really listening to the other person in conversation, or when you are in a conversation you  just  wait  for  your  turn  to  talk,  then  that  is  a  sign  of  foolishness.  Proverbs teaches  that  we  need  to  learn  to  restrain  our  mouths.  Proverbs  10:19  states, \"When there are many words, sin is unavoidable, but the one who controls his lips is prudent.\" Proverbs 17:27-28 adds, The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding. Even a fool is considered wise when he keeps silent-discerning, when he seals his lips. These verses sound similar to the more modern proverb attributed to Abraham Lincoln:  \"Better  to  remain  silent  and  be  thought  a  fool  than  to  speak  out  and remove all doubt.\" Proverbs is clear that speaking a lot leads to sin, whereas a restrained mouth is a sign of wisdom. At the very least, one might be considered wise-even  if  he  is  not-with  a  little  less  talking.  As  Goldsworthy  points  out, \"Ironically, the fool who has the wit to keep silent shows at least some potential for wisdom\" (Tree of Life, 131). There are at least two key reasons for restraining your mouth. First, control of the tongue protects you from impulsive speech. If you are rash with your words, "}
{"Page": 212, "Info": "you  can  do  much  damage.  Once  the  words  are  out  there,  you  cannot  get  them back. How many of us have come to understand this truth the hard way? How has talking before you listen or talking before you think affected your marriage, your  children,  your  friendships,  or  your  job?  Murphy  and  Huwiler  helpfully point  out,  \"Human  nature  being  what  it  is,  garrulousness  leads  to  all  kinds  of blunders\" (Proverbs, 51).37 Do you want to be a fool who ruins his relationships? Then talk too much! The second reason to restrain your tongue is because it will prevent you from self-confident  speech.  Proverbs  evaluates  self-confident  speech  as  foolishness. Self-confident speech is defined as loving to hear yourself talk or always having to  give  your  own  opinion  on  a  matter.  Proverbs  18:2  says,  \"A  fool  does  not delight  in  understanding,  but  only  wants  to  show  off  his  opinions.\"  Longman explains, The verse suggests that fools are again only interested in their own desires and ideas . . . [they do not] want to listen to people with competence. They only want to blurt out what is on their minds. (Proverbs, 354) Do you have a hard time listening to other people? Are you always confident in your evaluations of the matter? Do you think everyone else should listen to you? Do  you  have  a  hard  time  engaging  in  actual  conversations  because  you  are waiting for the other person to take a breath so you can start talking? Then you might be a fool! If you want to be a fool, speak before you listen. Also, speak more than you listen. But if you want to be wise, be slow to speak and quick to listen. Listen to Unwise Counsel PROVERBS 12:5 Not only does the fool usually listen only to himself, and not only does the fool speak more than he listens; but when the fool finally decides to listen to someone else,  he  listens  to  another  fool!  When  you  finally  listen  to  someone  else,  it  is only  to  unwise,  ungodly  counsel.  For  many  people  this  means  surrounding themselves with \"yes men\" who will simply tell them what they want to hear. So ask yourself these questions: Do you surround yourself with people who tell you what you want to hear, but not what you need to hear? Is there anyone in your life who has the freedom to lovingly criticize you or tell you no? Proverbs  12:5  states,  \"The  thoughts  of  the  righteous  are  just,  but  guidance from  the  wicked  is  deceitful.\"  Unwise  counsel  will  be  deceitful  because  it  will "}
{"Page": 213, "Info": "not tell you the way things really are. It will not lead you on the best course. It will  get  you  off  track.  Unfortunately,  Solomon  pleaded  with  his  son  over  and over  to  listen  to  wise  counsel  so  that  he  could  be  a  good  king;  but  his  son, Rehoboam, did not heed the advice of his father. Instead, Rehoboam listened to his peers-who told him what he wanted to hear-rather than listen to the elders who  gave  him  good  counsel,  and  it  ruined  his  kingdom  (1  Kgs  12).  Today, people get bad counsel all the time from coworkers or friends. When they have struggles  in  their  marriage  because  of  something  their  husbands  have  done, sometimes  their  coworkers  will  say  things  like,  \"Just  dump  the  loser!\"  That  is hardly  the  godly  advice  that  one  needs  to  hear  to  make  a  marriage  work. Proverbs  14:7  warns,  \"Stay  away  from  a  foolish  person;  you  will  gain  no knowledge  from  his  speech.\"  Wisdom  is  not  just  the  ability  to  listen,  but  it  is also the ability to discern whom or what to listen to and what to receive or reject! The  criteria  for  this  discernment  will  be  the  answer  to  this  question:  Is  this counsel consistent with God's Word? Let's  make  a  disclaimer  at  this  point.  There  is  a  potential  problem  in  even bringing this discernment up because when we say discernment is required, all of  a  sudden  we  \"discern\"  that  anyone  who  disagrees  with  our  opinion  on  the matter  is  unwise  and  should  not  be  heeded.  Again,  that  is  because  we  deceive ourselves and close our minds to counsel. If the person is willing to tell us what we need to hear, even if it is uncomfortable, and if their counsel runs consistent with the Bible, then you can be fairly confident that you need to listen to it. And even if you are not sure, you can always ask the question and ponder, \"Is there something I need to hear here?\" Unfortunately,  we  are  amazed  by  how  often  ungodly,  unbiblical  counsel  can come  from  other  Christians.  I  (  Jon)  once  knew  an  elderly  lady  who  began  a relationship with an unbeliever who had multiple failed marriages. They wanted to  get  married,  but  their  pastor  was  reluctant  because  the  groom  was  not  a Christian and because of his past failures. They liked each other and were lonely living by themselves, so they wanted to move in together while they waited for a pastor who would marry them. All of her Christian friends told her to go ahead and move in with the guy. They said at her age it was not that big a deal. That is an obvious example of unbiblical counsel, but we all can be guilty of the same thing.  Whenever  you  are  listening  to  counsel,  if  your  situation  is  seen  as  an exception clause to the biblical testimony, then you can bet that it is not godly advice.  People  love  to  follow  God's  Word  when  it  suits  them,  but  we  always "}

{"Page": 215, "Info": "Conclusion There are two things we need in order to be wise in this area of life. We need Jesus, and we need his body, the church. We need a relationship with Christ and to listen to his Word. Plus, we need brothers and sisters in our lives who can call us out and tell us the truth in love (Eph 4:15). Proverbs has revealed to us that wisdom is personal. If you recognize a pattern of  foolishness  in  your  life  in  the  area  of  not  listening  enough  or  talking  too much, it reveals a problem with Jesus. Not listening to counsel and talking too much is a spiritual, gospel issue. It reveals some issue-most likely that you do not recognize just how great a sinner you are! You do not really believe that you are prone to self-deception. Instead, you have set yourself up as god of your own life. If you have a proper spiritual life, you become progressively holy-more like Christ-as you walk with and submit to him. One of the ways you can tell if you are becoming more holy is if you can successfully receive a rebuke and make a correction in your life. After all, Jesus could remain silent when he needed to be quiet. And Jesus knew how to grow in wisdom by listening to the teachers in the temple  (Luke  2:46,52).  If  you  are  not  growing  in  your  ability  to  listen  to  wise counsel and measure your words, something is wrong in your relationship with Jesus Christ. Not  growing  in  Christlikeness  in  this  area  of  your  life  will  have  nasty consequences.  It  might  ruin  your  reputation  because  you  just  will  not  listen  to correction and you will continue to make the same mistakes. You might wreck your family because you think they are all wrong and you could not possibly be. You  could  get  fired  from  your  job  because  you  think  your  supervisor's evaluation is crazy. Do you want to be a fool and ruin your life? Then listen only to  yourself,  talk  more  than  you  listen,  surround  yourself  with  people  who  will only tell you  what  you want to hear,  and have the attitude, \"This is who I  am, and I'm not gonna change!\" That is deadly. The antidote is Jesus. Recognize your foolishness here, confess it to the Lord, and ask him for the wisdom that he gives generously. Ask Jesus to enable you to listen and measure words in the power of the Holy Spirit. Jesus is the Wisdom of God who has become wisdom for you and can make you wise. Read and listen to God's Word to gain wisdom. You will recognize that you are not always right and you need to submit to God's truth. "}
{"Page": 216, "Info": "You  also  need  Christ's  body;  you  need  a  community  of  faith.  In  the  church, you live life together and depend on each other. Proverbs is clear that associating with fools will make you foolish, but uniting with the wise will make you wise. Therefore, you need to be in relationships with other Christians who are seeking to walk with Jesus. You need to give these brothers and sisters freedom to speak into your life, just as you have freedom to speak into theirs. When  you  are  faced  with  a  tough  decision,  you  do  not  want  to  seek  counsel from those who will simply tell you what you want to hear. You need to be able to ask, \"Who are the godliest people I know, and what do they think about this?\" Do  not  adopt  a  \"me  and  Jesus\"  approach  to  decision  making.  That  is  foolish because it's usually more \"me\" than Jesus. Recognize how easily you deceive yourself, and thus restrain your mouth and listen  to  godly  counsel  in  your  local  church.  You  may  have  a  long  prayer  by yourself  each  morning,  and  you  may  be  involved  in  three  mid-week  Bible studies, and you might even serve on a deacon body, but whether or not you can listen to the counsel of others and control your tongue tells you a lot about your relationship with Christ.

To the Right Person A merican  Idol  brought  on  Ellen  DeGeneres  to  fill  the  big  void  left  by  Simon Cowell's departure, but Ellen did not stay with the music talent show very long. She said she quit because she realized she was not a good fit and added, \"I also realized this season that while I love discovering, supporting and nurturing young  talent,  it  was  hard  for  me  to  judge  and  sometimes  hurt  their  feelings\" (\"Ellen  DeGeneres  Bows  Out\").  Have  you  ever  watched  Idol,  particularly  the early rounds? If there is anywhere on the planet that people need to be told the harsh truth, it is on American Idol. People come on the show thinking they should be the next big superstars in America, yet they cannot carry a tune at all. The only reason they are convinced they are good is because the people in their lives have lied to them or pacified them. Their friends and family members have never told them  that  they  need  to  do  something  else,  instead  giving  them  a  false  sense  of competency  with  their  platitudes  like,  \"You  can  be  anything  you  want  to  be!\" Because no one has ever told them the hard truth, they do not see reality rightly. What we observe on Idol, we also see in the culture at large. We now live in a society  that  values  personal  freedom  over  the  truth  and  a  culture  that  values \"tolerance,\" which means you cannot ever tell someone he is wrong. We live in a  culture  that  says,  \"Let  people  live  their  lives  the  way  they  want  to  live  their lives,\" or, \"It's not your place to tell them how to live their lives,\" or, \"You don't have the right to tell someone that what she believes, thinks, or does is wrong. You  worry  about  yourself,  let  others  live  their  own  lives,  and  stay  out  of  their business.\" "}
{"Page": 219, "Info": "We  have  created  the  same  culture  within  the  church.  We  hear  things  like, \"Don't judge,\" \"Show grace,\" or \"Mind your own business.\" I ( Jon) heard the story  of  a  time  when  a  pastor's  daughter  tweeted  crass  things  on  social  media. When  a  church  member  lovingly  brought  it  up  to  the  pastor,  the  pastor's response  was,  \"Let  him  who  is  without  sin  cast  the  first  stone.\"  The  Bible commands  us  to  live  in  loving  and  accountable  community;  yet  we  reject accountability  at  every  turn,  even  in  the  church.  There  is  rarely  loving confrontation in the church. We rarely speak up when we see a brother or sister moving into foolish sin. We have been so influenced by a culture that says you cannot  impose  your  standard  on  someone  else  that  we  no  longer  live  out  the picture  of  the  New  Testament.  We  isolate  ourselves  from  others  and  do  not really  invite  people  into  our  lives  despite  the  biblical  exhortations  that  say  we need  each  other.  There  are  over  thirty  \"one  another\"  commands  in  the  Bible! They reveal that we cannot live the Christian life in isolation. We must learn how to speak up because people need to hear the truth spoken in love (Eph 4:15). We need people who will lovingly tell us the truth! If your friend has something stuck in her teeth or tissue paper on her shoe or his fly is open,  it  is  not  loving  to  simply  stay  quiet  out  of  fear  that  he  or  she  might  be embarrassed.  And  if  someone  is  on  a  fool's  path,  it  is  not  loving  to  refuse  to confront him simply because the world might say it is harsh. The world is wrong in many cases, and this is one of them! As  followers  of  Christ,  we  are  commanded  to  speak  up.  Despite  everyone's favorite phrase to quote out of context-\"Do not judge\" (Matt 7:1)-we are also commanded to judge Christians corporately in the church (1 Cor 5:12). Why do we  speak  up?  We  speak  up  because  we  do  not  want  the  people  we  love  to destroy their lives. We speak up and correct our children because we want them to learn how to live life. The most loving thing we can do is tell them the truth before  they  hurt  themselves  or  others.  We  speak  up  because  the  person  in  sin may  be  a  false  professor  who  has  convinced  himself  he  is  a  believer  when  he might  not  be.  If  he  remains  in  continual,  unrepentant  sin,  he  may  not  be genuinely saved, and we are commanded to confront him before it's too late so that we might gain a brother. We speak up and tell the truth in love to lost people when we witness to them. Church discipline on the big scale rarely works in our day and age. One of the key  reasons  is  that  we  are  not  doing  continual  church  discipline  on  the  small scale. Church discipline should be taking place all the time. Jesus said, \"If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you "}
{"Page": 220, "Info": "have  won  your  brother\"  (Matt  18:15).  These  kinds  of  private  conversations should happen all the time. The problem is that we do not have a culture of open confession of sin in the church because we think we will not be seen as \"good Christians\"  if  we  admit  our  struggles.  And  we  do  not  have  a  culture  of accountability  and  loving  confrontation,  so  by  the  time  it  progresses  to excommunication, people are rarely willing to listen. If we could create a culture of  loving  accountability  and  regular  confrontation-giving  and  receiving  it rightly-then  maybe  we  might  have  a  body  that  walks  in  holiness.  Proverbs repeats this need many times. Proverbs  27:5-6  says,  \"Better  an  open  reprimand  than  concealed  love.  The wounds  of  a  friend  are  trustworthy,  but  the  kisses  of  an  enemy  are  excessive.\" We  must  confront  because  we  love  people  and  want  their  good.  If  we  do  not confront, we do not really love them-we have concealed our love from them. Murphy and Huwiler argue that a rebuke is a \"true sign of love\" (Proverbs, 133). True friends-true brothers-tell you what you  need to hear, while false friends tell you what you want to hear. False friends \"kiss\" you in a way that makes you think they care, but actually they do not. Do you have a true friend who can get in your face and ask you what in the world you are doing? Are you that kind of friend  to  others?  We  need  to  learn  to  confront  occasionally  and  rightly  for  the good  of  those  we  love.  We  need  to  learn  to  receive  confrontation  for  our  own good. We  all  intuitively  know  there  are  times  we  need  to  speak  up.  For  example, when our friend is in a foolish relationship that is no good for him, we have to say something. When our friend is making dumb decisions with her money that constantly put her in bad situations, we need to speak up. When our brother in Christ  is  involved  in  something  that  jeopardizes  his  marriage,  we  have  to lovingly confront. Unfortunately, we often bite our tongues and say to ourselves things like, \"Oh, I could not possibly say anything.\" \"Oh, they won't listen to me anyway.\"  People  make  foolish  decisions  that  destroy  their  reputations, marriages,  families,  and  their  eternities.  So  while  it  is  tough  and  awkward  to speak up, we must do it! The question we want to examine from Proverbs is, How do I do it? How do I lovingly confront someone I care about? The answer is a math problem of sorts, and most if not everything in the formula needs to be present in confrontation. If most of these things are present, do not let fear keep you from speaking up: The Right Word + FROM the Right Person "}

{"Page": 222, "Info": "The Right Word The first criterion for speaking up is the right word. Is what you are about to say true?  Or  better  stated,  is  what  you  are  about  to  say  consistent  with  the  Bible? Proverbs has clearly stated that true wisdom comes from the mouth of God (2:6). Therefore, we do not need to advise people with our opinions; we need to advise them from the Bible. Too many people-when they actually do speak up-speak out of what they think rather than from what God has said. On social media you can  see  all  kinds  of  confrontation  about  how  to  give  birth  to  a  child,  how  to discipline a child, or how to date your wife, and much of it seems very dogmatic -even the advice that is blatantly wrong. If you are going to speak up, you need to be sure that what you are saying is consistent with the Bible, so take the time and do the work to make sure! "}
{"Page": 223, "Info": "From the Right Person To figure out if you are the right person, you need to be able to positively answer the question, Is this my fight? To figure out if that is the case, ask questions like, Am  I  the  offended  party?  Am  I  accountable  for  the  offended  party?  Am  I accountable  for  the  offender?  Proverbs  puts  it  this  way:  \"A  person  who  is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that's not his is like one who grabs a dog by the ears\" (26:17). As Longman points out, \"It is obviously stupid to pull the ears of  a  dog.\"  Therefore,  the  verse  \"ridicules  those  who  would  get  involved  in  a fight in which they have no part\" (Proverbs, 469). Do  not  be  the  \"confrontation  police.\"  Some  people  love  to  do  this  kind  of thing.  They  love  calling  people  out,  putting  them  in  their  place,  or  getting  in their business. Some people think their calling in life is to be an Old Testament prophet.  They  love  telling  their  friends  how  they  told  someone  off.  They  love jumping in and trolling on Facebook or Twitter. Proverbs says that jumping into someone else's argument is like slapping a pit bull  in  the  face.  It's  not  going  to  go  well  for  you!  Do  not  jump  into  someone else's fight. Do not speak up if it is not your place. Some fights need to be had, but they need to be by the right person. On the other hand, do not use this as an excuse  not  to  act  if  you  are  the  right  person.  Do  not  convince  yourself,  \"They will  never  listen  to  me.\"  If  it's  not  your  place,  stay  out  of  it,  but  if  it  is  your place, kindly and directly speak up! "}
{"Page": 224, "Info": "In the Right Way True  forgiveness  and  kindness  must  be  present  before  any  confrontation.  It  is easy  to  confront  a  wrong  done  you  if  you  are  hurt,  but  you  usually  do  not  go about  it  in  the  right  way  unless  you  have  moved  toward  forgiveness.  Without forgiveness, there will not be conflict resolution-only revenge. There cannot be the slightest bit of bitterness or a desire to get someone back, or it will blow up in your face. Proverbs 24:29 says, \"Don't say, \u2018I'll do to him what  he  did  to  me;  I'll  repay  the  man  for  what  he  has  done.'\"  I  have  seen families  in  a  church  meet  for  conflict  resolution,  but  each  party  merely  wants their case to be heard and to win the day. It has driven families apart and out of the church. Resist a superiority complex where you look down on the person you confront as if you are not a sinner or could never have done what they did. Let go of your grudge before you talk. If you dwell on what was done, turn it over in your mind often, and talk about it a lot with other people, then you are not going about it in the right way. Stop bringing  it  up!  Proverbs  17:9  warns,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense  promotes love,  but  whoever  gossips  about  it  separates  friends.\"  Be  willing  to  let  it  go. Overcome  evil  with  good,  since  judgment  ultimately  belongs  to  God,  not  you. Forgive as God in Christ has forgiven you (Eph 4:32)! Longman reminds us that \"a person who harps on problems will drive another away, robbing people of the opportunity  to  develop  a  relationship,\"  but  love  \"keeps  no  record  of  wrongs\" (1 Cor 13:5) (Proverbs, 345). Only  after  you  have  worked  through  forgiveness  can  you  then  confront. Proverbs 10:12 states, \"Hatred stirs up conflicts, but love covers all offenses.\" If your  confrontation  is  motivated  by  a  desire  to  get  someone  back,  it  will  not work.  In  fact,  it  will  only  make  it  worse.  There  are  some  things  that  you  just need to let go. But if your desire is forgiveness and reconciliation, there is hope! Also, the right way to confront someone is to do it with gentleness and love, or what Paul calls, \"speaking the truth in love\" (Eph 4:15). Proverbs 15:1 says, \"A gentle  answer  turns  away  anger,  but  a  harsh  word  stirs  up  wrath.\"  The temperaments we bring to the confrontation will make all the difference (Garrett, Proverbs, 150). Do you have the self-control to give a reasoned response? (Waltke, Proverbs,  Chapters  1-15,  612-13).  Gentleness  does  not  imply  mealy  mouthed  or indirect-it  can  be  a  tough  gentleness!  The  question  is,  Are  your  words motivated  by  love  for  her  or  by  a  desire  to  put  her  in  her  place?  Are  you genuinely concerned for the person, and therefore you will confront her kindly? "}
{"Page": 225, "Info": "Or do you just want to prove her wrong? If it is truly done gently, the hearer can say in her heart, \"I do not want to hear this, but I at least know this person loves me, and it kind of hurt him to have to say this to me.\" That kind of attitude can help in persuading someone of his or her need to change. Slamming that person or  being  sarcastic  will  not  help  bring  about  change.  After  all,  Proverbs  16:21 states,  \"Anyone  with  a  wise  heart  is  called  discerning,  and  pleasant  speech increases learning.\" Finally,  speaking  up  in  the  right  way  means  speaking  directly.  Do  not  beat around the bush. Do not try to use spin. Do not be passive aggressive. Proverbs 24:26  says,  \"He  who  gives  an  honest  answer  gives  a  kiss  on  the  lips.\"  Being honest and straightforward is beneficial to the hearer. That said, let me give you a  word  of  caution.  Often  those  good  at  directness  are  bad  at  gentleness.  And those who are good at gentleness can struggle with directness. We need both in our speaking. "}
{"Page": 226, "Info": "At the Right Time It  is  crucial  that  you  speak  up  at  the  right  time.  Proverbs  25:11-12  states,  \"A word  spoken  at  the  right  time  is  like  gold  apples  in  silver  settings.  A  wise correction  to  a  receptive  ear  is  like  a  gold  ring  or  an  ornament  of  gold.\"  You have to speak at the right moment (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 126). You  may  have  the  truth  and  say  it  in  a  gentle  way,  but  it  will  not  be  well received because you do not speak up at the right time. Proverbs does not give us a  \"how-to\"  manual  to  know  when  is  the  right  time.  Knowing  the  right  time requires discernment. Thankfully, God promises that if we lack wisdom, we can ask him and he will give it to us ( Jas 1). A  fool,  on  the  other  hand,  speaks  with  no  regard  to  the  circumstances.  He comes  in  when  his  wife  looks  frazzled  and  is  complaining  about  how  the  kids have been a handful all day, and he says, \"Honey, we need to have a talk.\" Or the fool wants to criticize the church to the pastor right after the pastor gets done preaching his heart out to his people. Proverbs  15:23  says,  \"A  person  takes  joy  in  giving  an  answer;  and  a  timely word-how  good  that  is!\"  Goldsworthy  notes,  \"There  is  great  satisfaction  in being  able  to  give  a  wise  word  at  the  right  time\"  (Tree  of  Life,  116).  Too  many people  who  actually  do  speak  up  have  the  mentality,  \"I  told  them  the  truth.  If they  do  not  receive  it,  that's  their  problem.\"  No!  Proverbs  says  that  it  is  your problem.  Truth  that  is  not  delivered  at  the  right  time  will  not  be  received. Sometimes  you  need  to  wait.  At  other  times  you  need  take  courage  and  speak immediately. Ask the Lord to help you with discernment. "}
{"Page": 227, "Info": "To the Right Person Some people will never respond rightly, nor will they receive what you say no matter how gentle you are or how timely you are. Proverbs describes these folks as \"mockers\" when it says, The one who corrects a mocker will bring abuse on himself; the one who rebukes the wicked will get hurt. Don't rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke the wise, and he will love you. (9:7-8) The mocker will not listen to your correction no matter how you go about it. On the other hand, the wise person will receive correction and will want to grow and change. This does not mean that people-even wise people-will always immediately receive your confrontation well. Sometimes it will take a while for them to see why what you are saying is good for them. It will require the work of the Holy Spirit.  Proverbs  28:23  states,  \"One  who  rebukes  a  person  will  later  find  more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.\" Yes, you can flatter people and tell them what they want to hear, but that is ultimately unloving and unhelpful. The verse  observes  that  a  good  reception  may  not  happen  immediately,  but  it  will happen  ultimately-\"later.\"  Longman  writes,  \"Although  it  is  true  that  initially people  are  likely  to  get  a  bad  reaction  from  those  whose  faults  they  are highlighting, this proverb indicates that favor, gratitude for the advice, will come not immediately but \u2018afterward'\" (Proverbs, 496). Unfortunately,  we  often  do  not  confront  because  we  prefer  the  short-term comfort to the long-term hard work. That is true with disciplining our children as well. Correction and confrontation may hurt in the short term, but it is better in the long term. You may have to risk a friendship, only to get it back later! Early in ministry I ( Jon) was discipling a guy who had a particular struggle with pornography. One time when we were hanging out, I confronted him very directly about his struggles and his excuses for them. He got up and walked out on me. It strained our relationship, but thankfully God used that and some other things  to  get  this  guy's  attention.  Several  years  later  he  wrote  me  a  thank-you note on Facebook: I realize it's been a while since I talked to you but want again to thank you for something you did for me several years ago. Remember probably in 2000-2001 maybe when you confronted me about some sin and I walked out on you? Thank you so much for being strong in that moment. I am involved in conversations with a person who used to attend our church that "}
{"Page": 228, "Info": "involved in conversations with a person who used to attend our church that has done some pretty bad things and I've been able to repeatedly share God's love with him as well as his imminent danger should he not repent. I honestly believe that had you not gotten into my business then and confronted me, I would be in a different place in life. You have my utmost respect for being strong in the faith and confronting me. My own experience from this tells me that your job can be both fantastically awesome and heartbreaking in the same day. I pray for you. Change may be slow in coming, but trust the Lord to do good work as you are faithful to speak up. Finally, we need to be the kind of people who can receive a confrontation and respond well. That is what wise people do. Proverbs 17:10 says, \"A rebuke cuts into a perceptive person more than a hundred lashes into a fool.\" Do not get mad when confronted. Ask, \"What can I learn from this?\" "}
{"Page": 229, "Info": "Conclusion Proverbs  27:5-6  says,  \"Better  an  open  reprimand  than  concealed  love.  The wounds  of  a  friend  are  trustworthy,  but  the  kisses  of  an  enemy  are  excessive.\" These verses point us to the gospel, not merely because Jesus was kissed by an enemy whom he thought was his friend but also because Jesus was wise enough to know how to confront. Jesus is the Son who grows in wisdom, and he is the Wisdom of God. He lived out these truths, and he can empower us to live them out as well. Whether or not you can give or receive a confrontation reveals whether or not the gospel is central in your life. If you are too scared to confront or too prideful to receive a confrontation, you have a problem with Jesus. The cross should not merely  be  a  hoop  you  jump  through  to  get  into  the  Christian  life;  the  cross transforms your life if you really rest in it! If you truly rest in the gospel, you can give a rebuke and receive one without getting mad like people usually do.38 When someone confronts us, they can be right or wrong, they can do it for the right reason or the wrong reason, and they can go about it in the right way or the wrong  way.  Our  typical-sinful-response  is  to  get  angry  and  say  things  like, \"Oh, no I didn't!\" We get angry because in our pride we want to be right all the time.  Therefore,  in  order  to  be  seen  as  right  we  lose  relationships  or  surround ourselves with yes men. But Proverbs tells us that confrontation is for our good. And if we truly believe the gospel, we can see how that is true. If I believe in the cross, I am crucified with Christ, and I died back there at Calvary. If I believe in the cross, it means that I agree with God's judgment of me and admit, \"I am a sinner!\" So I can say to any rebuke-fair or unfair-that it is just a fraction of my sin. And if I believe in the cross, I also agree with God's justification of my life-that God sees me now as he sees his beloved Son. I have God's approval. Since  pride  starts  fights  out  of  a  desire  to  justify  myself,  God's  verdict  can alleviate that. I do not have to justify myself because God has done so in Christ. Therefore,  you  can  handle  and  receive  any  criticism  because  no  one  can criticize  you  more  than  the  cross.  God  has  criticized  your  shortcomings  in  the cross  far  more  than  anyone  else  can.  You  can  thank  the  person  for  their correction, even if it is wrong, because it reminds you of your true faults that led to the crucifixion of Jesus. You are now free to consider, \"Is there anything valid here  that  I  need  to  listen  to?\"  And  you  can  handle  any  confrontation  without getting crushed or angry because you do not need man's approval since you have God's in Christ! "}
{"Page": 230, "Info": "If  you  can  take  confrontation  well,  then  you  can  learn  to  confront  with gracious intent. You do it for the right reason, not to be seen as right or to get others'  approval  but  because  you  have  God's  approval  in  Christ.  Giving  and receiving confrontation in a wise manner comes down to the gospel. "}
{"Page": 232, "Info": "Pray Up! PROVERBS 15:29 Main Idea: You can only pray to God through Jesus Christ. I. Who Can Pray to God? Only the Righteous Can (15:29). II. How Do We Pray to God? We Humbly Confess (28:13). E veryone-even  those  outside  the  church-think  that  God  hears  every prayer. Most people, some of whom do not even believe in Jesus or practice Christianity,  pray.  They  pray  for  their  children,  their  health,  and  their  families. Many people can even tell you that God \"always answers your prayers,\" but the answer could be yes, no, or maybe later. That  is  why  people  got  so  enraged  when  a  Southern  Baptist  Convention president had the audacity to say, \"God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a Jew\"  (\"Baptist  Leader\").  There  were  all  kinds  of  reasons  that  the  comment sparked  controversy  and  outrage  in  a  world  with  multiple  religions  and  a fondness for cultural pluralism. But one of the biggest reasons people were upset was  not  because  of  the  perceived  offense  to  the  Jewish  faith  specifically  but rather because anyone, especially a pastor, would dare suggest that God does not hear  someone's  prayer.  Everyone  believes  that  God  hears  and  responds  to  our prayers. Is it possible that God would give someone \"the silent treatment\"? Honestly, the Bible says yes to this question. God does give the silent treatment to some people. That might be alarming for many people. If that is true, some important questions need to be asked like, Whose prayer does God hear? Why might he not listen to mine? How can I pray in such a way that God will answer me? Let's look to the Proverbs and see the answers to these questions, so that our prayer  lives  can  be  radically  changed.  Proverbs  15:29  says,  \"The  LORD  is  far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous.\" What does this mean? Who Can Pray to God? Only the Righteous Can PROVERBS 15:29 This  verse  uses  Hebrew  poetic  parallelism.  There  are  several  kinds  of parallelism:  sometimes  the  second  line  says  something  similar  to  the  first; "}
{"Page": 233, "Info": "sometimes it says the opposite. In this case, one line can be looked at to fill out the other. So when the first line says that the Lord is far from wicked people, we can  conclude  that  he  is  near  righteous  people;  and  when  it  says  he  hears  the prayer  of  the  righteous,  we  can  surmise  that  he  does  not  hear  the  prayer  of wicked people. When the text says that he does not hear their prayer, it does not mean that he does not audibly hear it. He hears the words because he is an omniscient God, but  he  does  not  respond  to  them  (Longman,  Proverbs,  322).  He  will  not  do anything about the prayer. We understand what that is like. Sometimes we are in a conversation with someone and we tune him or her out, or we hear what they are saying as background noise but do not respond. God is not with the wicked in crisis like he is with the righteous. The Bible is clear on this point. Isaiah 59:2 says, \"But your iniquities are separating you from your  God,  and  your  sins  have  hidden  his  face  from  you  so  that  he  does  not listen.\" The problem for many of us is that we assume we are righteous. We think to ourselves, \"I am basically a good person,\" and we assume that God hears us. But the question must be asked, Who are \"the wicked\"? The Bible indicates that  we are!  The  wicked  are  those  who  reject  God's  law  and  instruction-those  who disobey  his  word.  We  have  all  sinned  and  fallen  short  of  God's  glory  (Rom 3:23).  We  are  all  wicked,  and  that  is  why  Proverbs  28:9  says,  \"Anyone  who turns his ear away from hearing the law-even his prayer is detestable.\" If you do not listen to Yahweh's word to you, he will not listen to your words to him! Murphy  and  Huwiler  refer  to  the  \"deafness  of  a  person\"  and  the  \"deafness  of God\" to their prayer (Proverbs, 138). Yahweh finds the prayers of sinners-all of us-detestable. He finds them repugnant (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 413). Therefore, if you do not listen to God's word (i.e., obey it), God will not listen to you. This includes sins of commission and omission-doing what you are not supposed to do and not doing what you are supposed to do. So if you lie, take God's  name  in  vain,  or  take  something  that  does  not  belong  to  you  (sins  of commission),  then  God  will  not  hear  your  prayer.  And  if  you  can't  let  go  of  a grudge,  you  are  selfish,  or  you  do  not  serve  your  wife  (sins  of  omission),  then God will not hear your prayer. For example, Proverbs says that the wicked are those  who  refuse  to  be  generous  to  the  poor,  and  thus  God  does  not  hear  their prayer: \"The one who shuts his ears to the cry of the poor will himself also call out and not be answered\" (21:13). If you are not generous to your neighbor, God "}
{"Page": 234, "Info": "will not hear your prayers. Murphy and Huwiler argue that it could be either man or God here in this verse (Proverbs, 105). In some ways, this truth may not seem all that shocking. Many people think, \"If you are a good person, God will listen to you; and if you are a bad person, God will not listen to you.\" We tend toward a works-righteousness approach that believes God is always more favorable to good people. So at this point you may be thinking, \"God will never accept me or listen to me because of all the sinful things I have done . . . he only hears good, church- going people.\" We think he only listens to pious people who pray in King James English using \"thee and thou.\" So you might be thinking you are going to have to  clean  up  your  act  and  start  doing  what  God  wants  you  to  do  so  that  he  will listen to you; and by that you mean things like get back in church, start giving, and  be  part  of  Bible  studies.  Wrong!  Proverbs  15:8  says,  \"The  sacrifice  of  the wicked  is  detestable  to  the  LORD,  but  the  prayer  of  the  upright  is  his  delight.\" Goldsworthy writes, \"The folly of the wicked is to think that formal and outward adherence to the law can benefit them in any way at all\" (Tree  of  Life, 115). The issue  is  the  \"sacrificer,\"  not  the  sacrifice;  it's  the  one  doing  the  ritual,  not  the ritual  itself.  God  cannot  stand  mere  religious  ritual  because  it  is  an  attempt  to manipulate  God.  Religious  ritual  that  is  not  accompanied  by  heart  change  is worthless.  This  type  of  religion  says,  \"If  I  am  good  and  do  what  God  says,  he will owe me some favors.\" That is manipulation. Mere behavior modification is not the answer; God detests it! People  in  the  Old  Testament  were  sinners  just  like  us,  so  sacrifices  were performed-similarly to the cross itself-to atone for sin and bring forgiveness. The  problem  is  that  God  says  the  wicked  are  not  really  repentant  or  humbly dependent  on  God.  They  think  if  they  just  perform  the  ritual  then  God  owes them,  like  people  today  think  if  they  just  go  to  church,  give,  and  have  a  quiet time,  then  God  has  to  answer  them.  Without  accompanying  faith  and dependence, these rituals are a waste of time. In  every  generation  people  have  tried  to  do  religious  rituals  in  an  attempt  to manipulate God's favor-to put God in their debt as if he owes them. At least three times in my life a ministry group has mass-mailed me a \"prayer rug.\" The so-called prayer rug is a picture of what people think Jesus's face looks like, and the note with the rug promises that if you will pray with your knees on this rug, God will give you $47,000 like he did with some poor soul under a mountain of debt.  This  ministry  promises  that  if  you  do  this  prayer  act,  God  will  give  you what you want. That's not Christianity; that's paganism! "}
{"Page": 235, "Info": "The problem is that we can comfort ourselves by saying, \"I'm not like that,\" but we do the same kind of thing. We think if we are good or if we do certain things, God will listen to us and act on our behalf. It may not be a prayer rug; it might  just  be  bargaining  with  God:  \"God,  if  you  get  me  out  of  this  jam,  I promise  I  will  walk  more  closely  with  you.\"  Or  we  think  if  I  just  give  up  my besetting  sin-pornography,  profanity,  or  my  temper-then  God  will  finally listen to me. If I can just turn over a new leaf, God will stop giving me the silent treatment. If I can just get this lust or this arrogance out of my life, maybe God will let us win the game, ace the exam, or get the job! This  approach  to  God  is  revealed  clearly  in  our  reluctance  to  approach  God when we feel like we are in the valley. I ( Jon) remember going through a period of rebellion in my freshman year of college and thinking, \"I can't even pray to God for forgiveness right now because I don't deserve for him to listen to me. He  must  be  so  angry  with  me  right  now.\"  Because  of  the  sin  in  your  life,  you feel  like  you  cannot  pray  or  that  it  will  not  do  any  good.  You  think  you  must clean yourself up first. That is also manipulative paganism, not Christianity. Therefore, no matter who we are, we have a huge problem. If you think you are  good  and  God  definitely  answers  your  prayers,  then  you  have  a  reality problem because the Bible says you are a sinner. And if you think you are bad and  God  will  not  listen  unless  you  clean  your  act  up,  then  you  have  a  religion problem because God is not manipulated by ritual! We have a big problem: God does not respond to the prayers of the wicked, and  that  is  us.  And  if  religion  is  not  the  answer,  how  can  we  pray  at  all? Humanity  has  had  this  problem  since  the  garden  of  Eden-we  have  been separated from God. In Psalm 24 the psalmist asks a key question about who can approach  God.  The  answer:  \"The  one  who  has  clean  hands  and  a  pure  heart\" (24:4). Clearly that is not us; only one man in history fits that description-Jesus of Nazareth, the King of glory (Ps 24:7). Jesus lived the perfect, righteous life that we could never live; then he died the death  we  should  have  died,  and  God  accepted  his  sacrifice  because  he  is  the righteous one (cf. Prov 15:8). Jesus was cut off from God-separated from the Father  for  us.  He  was  the  one  who  cried  out  and  was  unanswered  because  he bore  our  sin  in  his  own  body  on  the  cross  (Matt  27:46;  1  Pet  2:24).  And  it  is through  his  atonement  that  the  relationship  with  God  that  humanity  lost  in  the garden is finally restored. His death tore in two the veil separating humanity and God so that now we have bold access to the Father (Matt 27:51; Heb 10:19-22). "}
{"Page": 236, "Info": "God  heard  the  cries  of  his  righteous  Son  on  the  third  day  and  rescued  him from death. Then Jesus ascended the hill of the Lord to sit at the Father's right hand.  Now  he  always  lives  to  make  intercession  for  us  (Heb  7:25).  We  have access to boldly approach the throne in prayer and not shrink back (Heb 4:16). Our prayers are heard by God because Jesus is our righteous mediator before the Father, and through his righteousness-not ours-God answers our prayers! How Do We Pray to God? We Humbly Confess PROVERBS 28:13 Since we are wicked and do not deserve for God to hear us, and since the only way we have access is through Jesus, then the only manner in which we should come  before  God  is  humble  dependence.  We  recognize  that  it  is  only  through Jesus that we have access. That is what it means to pray in Jesus's name. It is not a magic formula to tack on at the end of the prayer; it is acknowledgement that Jesus is the one who grants us access to the Father so that he hears us! Since we are sinners, the first step in our prayer life should be to admit our sin and confess it to God. Proverbs 28:13 says, \"The one who conceals his sins will not  prosper,  but  whoever  confesses  and  renounces  them  will  find  mercy.\" Proverbs says not to hide or deny our sin but to confess it and abandon it. Adam and Eve attempted to hide their sin in the garden (Gen 3); we are called to do the opposite. We cannot minimize our sin, act like it is not there, or attempt to cover it.  Also,  confession  is  more  than  simply  being  sorry  that  we  got  caught  or  the fear  of  the  consequences  of  our  actions.  Confession  is  admitting  that  you  have sin in your life, agreeing that it deserves judgment, crying to God for mercy, and agreeing that you need to abandon it altogether. Some people try to confess their sin  without  forsaking  their  sin.  They  feel  bad  about  it,  but  they  do  not  take measures  to  kill  it  in  their  life.  You  must  fight  against  your  sin!  You  must  be killing sin or sin will be killing you. If you think you are good enough, you are dead wrong. The only way to come into God's presence is to admit that you do not belong. Righteousness is found in repentance. As Proverbs has indicated, rituals that are not accompanied with penitent  piety  are  detestable.  We  do  not  try  to  manipulate  God;  we  humbly depend on his mercy through Christ. The problem is that even Christians who know the good news start to act like pagans. We start to believe the lie that we have to clean up our act for God to respond favorably to us, and that if we do not clean up our act, God will zap us. That is not grace. We humbly and simply plead for the mercy of God through the "}

God accepted  one  man's  prayer  and  rejected  the  other  man's  prayer.  The  shocking turn  of  events  was  that  the  story  did  not  follow  expected  patterns.  Everyone listening to Jesus expected the righteous-looking, religious Pharisee to be heard; and  they  expected  the  sinful  tax  collector  to  be  given  the  silent  treatment.  But Jesus said the tax collector was heard because he was too ashamed to even lift his eyes to heaven as he said, \"God, have mercy on me, a sinner!\" (Luke 18:13). God  did  not  only  hear  that  man,  but  God  also  justified  him.  If  you  want  to  be heard by the King of the universe, then come humbly as a sinner and plead the mercy of Christ. "}

Envy is deadly because it hurts the people around you. C. Envy is deadly because it leads to other sins. D. Envy is deadly because it will be judged by God. II. Faith in Jesus Will Save You from Envy. ( Jon) am a huge Dallas Cowboys fan. When I was younger, I would get really I angry  when  they  lost  football  games  and  would  often  slap  my  hand  on  the carpet as hard as I could. My dad would look at me and say, \"Why are you doing that?  What  do  you  think  that  will  do?  You  are  only  hurting  yourself,  and  you might break your hand.\" The  Bible  seems  to  say  the  same  thing  about  envy.  Envy  never  helps  the situation,  and  it  ends  up  hurting  you.  We  see  examples  of  this  throughout  pop culture. In the movie Gladiator, the jealousy of the emperor toward Maximus was the  emperor's  undoing.  In  the  movie  Toy  Story,  Woody's  jealousy  toward  Buzz ended  up  hurting  Woody.  In  our  own  lives,  our  jealousy  of  others  can  lead  to depression,  low  self-esteem,  anger,  bitterness,  and  other  issues.  That  is  exactly what Solomon tells us through the Holy Spirit about jealousy and envy. Jealousy does not help; it only hurts. Proverbs 14:30 says, \"A tranquil heart is life to the body,  but  jealousy  is  rottenness  to  the  bones.\"  Jealousy  has  psychosomatic effects on you (Murphy and Huwiler, Proverbs, 71). It is like a cancer in your soul. Avoid Jealousy and Envy Because They Are Deadly When I ( Jon) was a freshman in high school, I was cut from the school's junior varsity basketball team. I got extremely jealous because the principal's nephew made  the  team  while  I  got  cut  from  it.  Instead,  I  played  in  a  city  optimist's league,  where  anyone  who  paid  the  fee  could  play.  I  thought  that  winning  the city  league  championship  (which  we  did)  would  make  things  right  because  I would  prove  that  I  was  a  better  basketball  player  than  the  principal's  nephew. "}
{"Page": 241, "Info": "However,  Solomon  is  right.  Winning  the  city  league  did  not  make  getting  cut from the team hurt any less, it did not put me on the team, and it led to a very depressed year of school. Envy-wanting  something  someone  else  has-is  destructive.  So  many  of  us want things that other people have. We envy their clothes, their car, their house, their  bank  account,  and  their  popularity.  That  attitude  is  destructive,  but  the reverse  attitude  can  be  as  well.  Jealousy  sometimes  looks  like  the  craving  to keep what is ours and not let it become someone else's. Longman explains both of  these  and  makes  his  own  distinction  between  jealousy  and  envy  when  he writes,  \"Jealousy  is  the  angry  desire  to  keep  what  we  possess  and  are  afraid someone else wants,\" whereas envy \"is the angry desire for what someone else possesses\" (Proverbs, 476). Though none of us really want to admit this because it lets other people gain even more power over us, we have all felt jealousy and envy. We have all felt spite or resentment when our peers succeed over us. We get jealous when people out-achieve us. Even pastors deal with this. Why is his church bigger? Why are they  growing  while  we  are  declining?  Why  do  they  have  so  much  money  for ministry, while we are drowning in debt? People  get  jealous  for  all  sorts  of  reasons.  People  get  suspicious  that  they might  be  replaced  at  work,  or  maybe  a  new  friend  has  entered  the  picture  and they are worried their relationships will never be the same. Or your single friend got married and is not spending as much time with you anymore. You are having a hard time dealing with it. Jealousy  happens  in  all  kinds  of  situations  in  our  lives.  Jealousy  is  common with romantic relationships. You cannot believe that he likes another girl, so you are mean to her all the time. Or you compete for his affection because you want it all for yourself. This kind of jealousy also can happen in corporate life. When your  rival  has  some  kind  of  success,  it  eats  you  up;  or  when  he  fails,  it  makes your day. It happens in church life as well. Church members get worried that if the church grows too much they might lose their seat, so they become resentful toward new folks. People get jealous when it comes to their looks. You look at yourself and wish you had muscles like him; or you wish that you had her looks, so  you  find  yourself  badmouthing  her  to  other  people  to  compensate  for  your jealousy. At some point we all find ourselves wishing that we were as strong, as smart,  as  popular,  as  successful,  as  wealthy,  as  athletic,  and  as  competent  as others.  Social  media  can  take  this  to  new  heights  when  people  post  all  about their lives and families, which causes even more comparison and jealousy. "}
{"Page": 242, "Info": "The Bible condemns that kind of jealousy, but it is a bit complicated because according to the Bible jealousy can also be a legitimate emotion (see discussion on this in Longman, Proverbs, 307). Like anger, jealousy is not always a bad thing. Jealousy  is  not  wrong  when  it  involves  an  exclusive  relationship  being threatened.  For  example,  God  is  jealous  for  his  people  and  their  exclusive devotion  to  him  (Zech  8:2;  Jas  4:5).  God  is  also  jealous  for  his  glory  (Num 25:11). There should be a positive jealousy and passion for exclusive devotion to God. The  same  can  be  said  for  our  mate  in  marriage!  Some  guys  are  real  idiots when it comes to their wife's jealousy for their relationship. Oftentimes when a wife questions her husband about a relationship with another woman out of love for  her  husband  and  concern  for  her  marriage,  the  husband  will  get  angry  and defensive  and  try  to  make  his  wife  feel  like  a  moron-like  she  does  not  know what she's talking about. That is ridiculous and foolish. Your wife's concern for your marriage and her willingness to ask you about it is a gift from God. However,  when  it  comes  to  non-exclusive  relationships  or  anger  over  what belongs  to  someone  else,  jealousy  is  wrong.  Not  only  is  jealousy  wrong,  it  is destructive and deadly. Envy Is Deadly Because It Hurts You Envy  damages  you  emotionally,  mentally,  and  physically.  Proverbs  14:30  says that jealousy has harmful psychosomatic consequences, whereas being content in your  heart  will  lead  to  physical,  mental,  and  emotional  well-being.  This  verse alludes  to  the  covenant  curse  of  physical  decay  for  those  who  violate  the  law, including God's command that we be content with what we have. Jealousy is a cancer of the bones. It eats away at you (Longman, Proverbs, 307). When you are jealous  it  can  lead  to  being  angry  all  the  time,  hives  breaking  out,  eating disorders,  uncontrolled  rage,  or  simply  not  thinking  straight.  When  you  walk around jealous and angry, it ruins you emotionally. Jealousy that finds its roots in checking out other people on social media can not only discourage you, it can also cause you to not be thankful for the life you have. Envy Is Deadly Because It Hurts the People around You Proverbs 27:3-4 says, A stone is heavy and sand, a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both. Fury is cruel, and anger a flood, but who can withstand jealousy? The  theme  of  these  verses  is  unbearable  behavior  that  other  people  cannot endure  (Waltke,  Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31,  374).  Do  you  get  what  the  wise  man  is "}
{"Page": 243, "Info": "saying?  Violence  is  bad,  and  a  temper  is  bad.  They  are  harmful  to  people,  but jealousy is even more destructive! Jealousy cannot be endured. When you are a jealous  person,  no  one  wants  to  be  around  you  and  all  the  drama.  It  destroys friendships  because  \"fury  that  stems  from  jealousy  is  not  open  to  reason  or moderation\" (Garrett, Proverbs, 216). Envy Is Deadly Because It Leads to Other Sins We see an example of this in the Bible in the way Saul feels about David. His jealousy of David causes him several times to try to kill David (1 Sam 18:9-11; 19:9-11) (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 375). Jealousy leads to other sins because at its root it is a belief of the heart that what God has given you is not enough. God  is  withholding  his  best  from  you.  That  dissatisfaction  and  feeling  of inadequacy causes you to lash out in all kinds of ways: violence, gossip, theft, and more. Another  way  that  envy  leads  to  other  sins  is  when  you  copy  the  behavior  of the prosperous, wicked person. The Bible says that envy of sinful people-who seem to prosper-leads to imitating their behavior. Proverbs 24:1-2 says, \"Don't envy the evil or desire to be with them, for their hearts plan violence, and their words stir up trouble.\" Jealousy of sinful people who are successful will lead you to adopt their behavior to get what they have. Instead, you should see that their behavior is despicable and you should not want to lower yourself to their level. Being  repulsed  by  their  angry,  badmouthing,  and  bitter  attitudes  should  be  a motivation to avoid jealousy (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 268). Envy Is Deadly Because It Will Be Judged by God Several  passages  of  Scripture  warn  us  not  to  envy  sinners  who  prosper,  since God  will  judge  them.  Wisdom  says  not  to  join  them.  Proverbs  3:31-32  states, \"Don't  envy  a  violent  man  or  choose  any  of  his  ways;  for  the  devious  are detestable to the LORD, but he is a friend to the upright.\" The application of the verse is clear: do not be envious of and thus copy the practices of a sinner. It is tempting  to  be  jealous  of  those  who  succeed  despite  their  sinful  behavior.  If  it was  not  tempting,  then  so  many  people  would  not  find  it  appealing.  When ungodly  people  find  themselves  having  all  that  they  want  while  godly  persons have very little, then godliness can seem like it does not benefit much. But we are told to avoid this, and one of the big reasons is that the Lord will condemn the  wicked.  The  tables  will  turn.  The  \"prospering  sinner\"  will  lose  all  that  he has, and the righteous will be rewarded in the end. God's approval abides on the content  person,  and  that  approval  is  worth  so  much  more  than  those  good- "}
{"Page": 244, "Info": "looking  things  the  sinner  has.  God  tells  you  to  trust  his  Word  rather  than  your experience  because  the  prosperity  of  the  ungodly  is  only  apparent;  it  will  be short lived. Proverbs  24:19-20  adds  the  eternal  perspective:  \"Don't  be  agitated  by evildoers, and don't envy the wicked. For the evil have no future; the lamp of the wicked  will  be  put  out.\"  Do  not  be  jealous  of  sinners,  since  the  tables  will  be turned at judgment. The sinner has no future. So it is foolish to adopt his ways for a few decades of pleasure and seeming prosperity in light of eternity. It is clear from Proverbs that the wages of jealousy is death: it rots your bones, it destroys your relationships, and it will send you to hell! So jealousy is a matter of life and death. Envy causes you to shrivel up, it eats away at you, and it casts you into darkness. The apostle Paul says about jealousy that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God (Gal 5:19-21). Faith in Jesus Will Save You from Envy Proverbs  24:19-20  gave  the  negative  warning,  but  Proverbs  23:17-18  gives  the positive  promise,  \"Don't  let  your  heart  envy  sinners;  instead,  always  fear  the LORD. For then you will have a future, and your hope will not be dashed.\" We see in these verses a positive strategy for dealing with our jealousy, and it just happens to be the theme of Proverbs: fear the Lord. That means to fight off envy and  jealousy  in  your  life  is  to  trust  in  the  Lord-to  have  whole-hearted confidence  in  him!  Again,  there  is  a  temptation  to  be  jealous  of  prosperous wicked people in such a way that you copy their actions. What is the antidote? The antidote to jealousy is contentment in the Lord. What is the motivation for this  contentment?  The  future  reward  of  eternal  life  is  the  motivation  to  be content in the Lord. Again, you must have an eternal perspective (Col 3:1-2). In light  of  eternity,  if  you  fear  the  Lord,  you  will  experience  eternal  blessings.  In contrast, the wicked will lose everything that they have. Proverbs  24:20,  interpreted  canonically,  may  refer  to  the  preservation  of  the messianic  line  because  the  \"lamp\"  often  refers  to  progeny  (Fox,  Proverbs  10-31, 564).  The  lamp  is  connected  to  the  Davidic  dynasty  because  David's  life  is referred to as the \"lamp of Israel\" and God is concerned that David always has a lamp  in  Israel  (i.e.,  an  heir;  2  Sam  21:17;  1  Kgs  15:4).  Psalm  132  applies  the same  lamp  imagery  to  the  Messiah.  The  hope  is  to  preserve  the  messianic  line until  Messiah  comes  by  not  envying  the  wicked.  The  promise  of  an  eternal kingdom ultimately brings an overlap of posterity with eternal life. There either had to be an eternal succession of faithful posterity or eventually an eternal son "}

We can enter  this  eternal  kingdom  if  we  trust  in  the  King  and  thus  turn  away  from jealousy toward him! Believing the gospel brings eternal and abundant life-the life that God meant for you to live. That is what the book of Proverbs is all about. The gospel story itself  is  a  story  about  jealousy.  Jealousy  killed  Jesus.  His  influence  over  the people drove the Jewish leaders to insanity. After all, the Bible says the Jewish leaders  handed  Jesus  over  to  the  Romans  \"because  of  envy\"  (Matt  27:18).  Not only was it the jealousy of the Jews that caused the death of Jesus, but our own jealousies killed him. He hung on the cross to pay the penalty for our jealousy. Every time you resented someone else's promotion, got green-eyed at someone else's popularity, or raged at another person's good looks, you added your sin in killing Jesus. But  the  good  news  is  that  God's  jealousy  to  have  an  exclusive  relationship with us motivated him to send his Son to die for our sins. Even though his bride had  satisfied  herself  with  so  many  idolatrous  lovers,  God  was  zealous  to purchase her and satisfy her with himself alone. He loves you and wants you to be his. So say this to yourself when you feel jealousy rising in your heart: Jesus drowned in his own blood so I can be satisfied in him. I don't need those things that I so jealously want because I have Jesus, and he is all I need. Conclusion We  have  been  jealous  and  envious;  but  Jesus,  who  never  was,  died  for  us  to forgive  us  and  save  us.  He  is  the  one  who  can  not  only  forgive  you  for  your jealousy, but he can also empower you by his Spirit to live a life that is free from envy.  As  we  have  seen  throughout  Proverbs,  foolishness  is  a  faith  issue.  The problem is not one of effort but of belief. Foolishness in our lives shows us that we are not believing in Jesus, and that is so true when it comes to the foolishness of jealousy. You are jealous because you are not satisfied and happy in all that he is for you. Faith in Jesus will free you from that jealousy. Your future hope in Christ is much greater than whatever that alluring thing is that someone else has right now. "}

Bill Cutrer was one of my dad's best friends, and he was also my mom's ob-gyn.  He  delivered  my  three  brothers  and  me  (  Jon).  In  fact,  when  my mom was pregnant with my twin brother and me, she had to be put on bed rest. My parents stayed at the Cutrers' house during that whole time. He also showed my wife and me an ultrasound of our daughter Maddy before she was born. He was a great friend to our family, and he died a couple years ago from unexpected heart failure. But one of the things I found out at his funeral that I did not know was that when my dad first met Bill, it was at a men's dinner at the church where my  dad  was  the  associate  pastor.  My  dad  just  so  happened  to  sit  at  the  table where Bill was sitting, and they struck up a conversation. Bill was a very funny guy, and he liked to pick at you a little. So the first thing that Bill ever said to my dad-who  was  in  seminary  at  the  time  and  a  little  bit  heavier  than  he  should have  been-was,  \"You  know,  I  noticed  that  Baptist  preachers  love  to  preach against  alcohol  and  smoking,  but  you  never  talk  about  gluttony.  Why  is  that?\" That eventually led to a friendship where they began to run together and train for a marathon. What  Bill  said  jokingly  is  actually  pretty  accurate.  Most  people  have  never heard a sermon on gluttony, but most people have heard sermons on the evils of smoking,  gambling,  and  alcohol.  This  study  will  address  the  alcohol  and gluttony issues. The Bible says in the book of Proverbs that a lack of self-control when it comes to your appetite for food or drink is foolish and destructive. When  was  the  last  time  you  heard  a  sermon  on  gluttony?  Fundamentalist Christianity,  especially  in  the  South,  really  loves  to  bash  alcohol  but  does  not want  to  touch  gluttony.  Why?  Well  probably  because  gluttony  hits  a  little  too close to home. After all, it is so well known that Baptists love to eat that people often  make  jokes  about  it.  If  you  asked  somebody  on  the  street,  \"What  are Baptists  known  for?\"  you  would  probably  get  two  responses:  fighting  and "}

One  man  said  at  the  Southern  Baptist  Convention  a  number  of  years ago that the SBC is the only convention where you find the donut vendor right next  to  the  sermon  tapes!  We  joke  about  that,  but  one  of  the  big  problems  of fundamentalism has been condemning the sins of others while ignoring our own sins. Often we are unable to inspect ourselves the way we inspect the world. It is a massive issue, and preachers are guilty of playing into it. A pastor can stand in a pulpit every Sunday and preach hard-really hard-against sin, and everyone says  of  the  pastor  things  like,  \"He  tells  it  like  it  is.\"  \"He  is  a  hellfire  and brimstone preacher.\" \"He's not afraid to call sin, \u2018sin.'\" And the preacher can get a lot of \"amens\" doing that. And yet, he really is a coward because he does not touch  the  sins  of  his  congregation  but  only  those  of  the  people  outside  his religious  community.  We  can  give  the  impression  that  what  God  really  cares about is homosexuality, drug addictions, and wild partying, but he is not all that concerned about judgmentalism, self-righteousness, and gluttony! Gluttony  is  a  major  problem  in  America  and  in  the  church.  It  is  often  an avoided topic because so many of us struggle with it. We also tend to think it's just  a  physical  issue,  not  really  a  gospel  issue.  Unfortunately,  it  seems  that Michelle  Obama  and  The  Biggest  Loser  have  taught  Americans  more  biblical principles about food than the church has. Preachers notwithstanding, the Bible is absolutely concerned with overindulgence and gluttony. We  like  to  bash  alcohol  and  its  dangers;  and  rightly  we  should  because  it destroys  family  ties,  social  lives,  physical  health,  and  even  life  itself.  Yes,  we should talk about the dangers of alcohol, but we should be honest about the fact that gluttony is also a big a problem in America. It can be just as deadly. We are eating  ourselves  to  disease  and  death.  Let's  look  at  some  stats  to  back  that statement up-some are humorous, but others are not quite so funny. In  1957  a  fast  food  hamburger  weighed  one  ounce  and  was  210  calories. Today  a  fast  food  hamburger  averages  about  six  ounces  and  618  calories.  In 1957  a  McDonald's  burger,  fries,  and  Coke  totaled  590  calories;  today  a \"supersized\" Quarter Pounder meal notches 1,550 calories. If you eat a Big Mac and  large  fries  and  drink  a  large  Coke,  you  will  have  to  walk  non-stop  for  six hours to burn off the calories. In 1957 a box of movie theater popcorn was three cups and 170 calories; currently it averages sixteen cups and 900 calories. There are more than 160,000 fast-food restaurants in America. Fifty million Americans eat fast food daily, and $110,000,000 is spent on it annually. What  is  the  result?  Women  are  at  a  double  risk  for  heart  failure.

In the  1950s,  9.7  percent  of  American  adults  were  considered  clinically  obese; today  the  United  States  leads  the  world  with  an  obesity  rate  of  more  than  30 percent-yes,  we  are  number  one!  We  have  the  highest  rate  of  calorie consumption per capita in the world. Childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and tripled in adolescents in the past thirty years. In 2010 more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese. Let that soak in. Why  is  this  happening?  The  CDC  says  it  is  a  result  of  \"caloric  imbalance.\" Translation: we eat too much and are not active enough! Obese youth are more likely  to  have  risk  factors  for  cardiovascular  disease,  high  cholesterol,  high blood  pressure,  prediabetes,  bone  and  joint  problems,  and  sleep  apnea,  and  as adults increased risks for types of cancer (\"Childhood Obesity Facts\"). We  are  literally  eating  ourselves  to  death.  We  are  unable  to  control  our appetites.  Our  lack  of  self-control  with  money,  sex,  drink,  and  food  will  kill almost  every  American  before  any  terrorist  or  foreign  army.  If  we  would  just listen to God's Word we could be instructed in wisdom in this vital area. Listen, my son, and be wise; keep your mind on the right course.

{"Page": 250, "Info": "Overindulgence Is Deadly PROVERBS 23:19-20 God created the world good, and everything in it worked right. The Creator gave good gifts to his creation for people to enjoy with grateful and worshiping hearts. He gave us things like food, drink, and sex to be enjoyed in the right context and to move us to worship him. The problem is that humanity rebelled against God's word  and  departed  from  God's  design,  which  led  to  brokenness.  In  our brokenness, our affections focus on the gifts rather than the Giver! So now we do not use God's gifts in ways he intended, but rather we use them in ways that he  forbids  because  he  knows  it  will  be  harmful  to  us.  Food  becomes  gluttony, drink becomes drunkenness, and sex becomes fornication and adultery. The gifts in  and  of  themselves  are  not  bad  things-they  are  good  things-but  we  turn them  into  ultimate  things,  and  they  become  bad  for  us.  Food  is  not  bad  thing. You  have  to  eat  to  live,  and  there  are  times  of  feasting  that  are  a  means  of worshiping God. Sex is not a bad thing. It is a great gift to be enjoyed rightly in heterosexual marriage. Drink is not bad in and of itself, but these things become bad when we use them in ways God did not intend-namely, overindulgence. The subject is complicated by the fact that it is hard to define gluttony. It is not bad to eat or even to want food because we need it to survive, and God gave it to us for our enjoyment! But it is bad to overeat or to eat a wrong thing or to lack self-control when it comes to eating. Balance is needed. The normal routine is to eat  in  moderation  with  times  for  fasting  and  feasting.  It  is  not  only  difficult  to define gluttony because eating is a good thing, but it is also difficult because the Bible  does  not  equate  gluttony  with  being  overweight.  There  are  numerous reasons  why  someone  might  be  overweight  that  are  not  necessarily  linked  to gluttony  or  overeating.  Some  people  are  predisposed  to  certain  things. Furthermore, you may be as skinny as a rail and still be a glutton-just a glutton blessed with a fast metabolism. So  how  do  you  know  when  you  have  crossed  the  line?  John  Piper  defines gluttony as a craving for food or drink that masters you (\"How Can I Conquer Gluttony?\"). If I ( Jon) am completely honest, that is me! I am mastered by food. So gluttony can be eating too much or drinking too much. An addiction to food or drink that you cannot control is gluttony. Gluttony-and we will walk through some  of  this  in  Proverbs-can  be  eating  food  that  is  too  rich  or  costly  (too often), or it can be eating too soon or at inappropriate times. I used to frequently have  a  \"fourth  meal\"  at  Taco  Bell,  and  I  like  the  Hobbits'  idea  of  \"second "}
{"Page": 251, "Info": "breakfast\"  and  \"elevensies.\"  Gluttony  can  be  eating  bad  food  coupled  with inactivity. Gluttony can be eating too fast so that your stomach doesn't catch up with  your  eyes.  Or  gluttony  can  be  eating  without  gratitude  to  God  for  his provision. Therefore,  the  issue  is  not  when  we  use  these  things  in  moderation-even beverage alcohol according to the Bible. The issue is overuse. As we have said, many  in  modern  Christianity  bash  alcohol  while  practicing  gluttony;  but  these verses  place  meat  in  the  same  category  as  wine.  The  warning  is  about  the overuse of alcohol and its hazards as well as the danger of overusing food. And if we miss how great the temptation to overindulge food is, it might be helpful to know that the word for meat here literally refers to \"the meat next to the bone\" (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31, 256)-the yummiest part! As we walk through these verses let's be honest about what the Bible says and submit  to  it.  The  Bible  does  not  condemn  the  consumption  of  alcohol  in moderation (though the principles of wisdom and witness in our cultural context may lead us to abstain); it condemns the overuse of it. And we should not make unsustainable arguments like saying the wine in the Bible was just grape juice. There would be no warnings against drunkenness if the drink was not fermented. We think it is safe to say that the alcohol content was not as high then as many drinks today, but it was actual wine (Stein, \"Wine-Drinking in New Testament Times\").  Every  word  for  wine  in  the  Old  Testament  and  the  New  Testament referred to an alcoholic drink (i.e., what Noah drank in Gen 9:21, the new wine in  Hos  4:11,  the  sweet  wine  in  Isa  49:26,  or  the  communion  wine  that congregants got drunk on in 1 Cor 11:21). So, as with food, there are two sets of texts in the Bible on wine: warnings and commendations. Proverbs has many warnings about the dangers of alcohol and its  consequences.  Proverbs  23:29-35  gives  a  vivid  description  of  this,  even describing the spinning sensation of drunkenness. Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has conflicts? Who has complaints? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has red eyes? Those who linger over wine; those who go looking for mixed wine. Don't gaze at wine because it is red, because it gleams in the cup and goes down smoothly. In the end it bites like a snake and stings like a viper. Your eyes will see strange things, "}
{"Page": 252, "Info": "and you will say absurd things. You'll be like someone sleeping out at sea or lying down on the top of a ship's mast. \"They struck me, but I feel no pain! They beat me, but I didn't know it! When will I wake up? I'll look for another drink.\" The Bible warns that alcohol will destroy you, and it is right. Sadly, there are too many instances of this reality to count. My ( Jon's) mother, Charlotte, grew up in a Baptist children's home because of an alcoholic dad and mom who could not  care  for  her.  My  adopted  cousin  was  born  with  fetal  alcohol  syndrome because of a biological mother who drank throughout her pregnancy. When she was little, my cousin would sit and bang her head against a wall for an hour as a result of the disease. These biblical warnings and sober tales need to be told in the midst of a culture that celebrates and laughs at drunkenness. Brad Paisley's song \"Alcohol\" giggles at how with alcohol you have had some of the best times you  won't  remember  and  that  it  teaches  white  people  how  to  dance.  Even  in some  Christian  circles  there  is  the  expectation  that  children  will  go  wild  in college. The Bible says that what overindulging in alcohol can do is not funny, and tragically we know that all too well in our society. And  yet,  we  must  be  honest  that  the  Bible  also  commends  wine  in  a  certain context.  Exodus  29:40  refers  to  a  drink  offering,  and  Deuteronomy  14:24-26 describes  a  party  with  food  and  wine  as  a  means  of  worship.  Psalm  104:14-15 says, He causes grass to grow for the livestock and provides crops for man to cultivate, producing food from the earth, wine that makes human hearts glad- making his face shine with oil- and bread that sustains human hearts. Sex,  we  all  admit,  can  be  used  rightly  or  wrongly.  Sex  in  heterosexual marriage is good, while adultery is condemned as sinful. Too many people view wine like adultery (i.e., sinful sex) instead of viewing it like sex itself, which can be  used  rightly  or  wrongly.  Not  every  use  of  alcohol  is  sinful.  Discernment  is required. You must know yourself. Some need to avoid wine at all cost because of  possible  addiction  or  because  they  are  underage.  In  many  situations  and contexts it is not a bad practice to abstain from alcohol as a matter of wisdom. After  all,  you  will  never  get  addicted  if  you  never  take  the  first  drink.  Or  one might abstain as a matter of witness-not wanting others to stumble. Paul tells the church at Rome to consider witness, but he also tells them to be charitable to "}
{"Page": 253, "Info": "each other. Let people make their own choices and do not judge them. We have freedom  here  to  make  different  choices  (Rom  14),  but  they  need  to  be  wise choices. Overindulging  food  (gluttony)  or  drink  (drunkenness)  is  always  unwise  and deadly. Proverbs says it leads to poverty (23:21), and we also can observe this in our culture. Gluttony leads to poverty for all kinds of reasons. Some people get fired  because  of  an  addiction  that  affects  their  work.  Others  perform  poorly  at work because they are lethargic after eating a huge lunch, and their supervisors notice  their  lack  of  productivity  when  reviews  come  around.  Others  overspend on food they want-eating out at restaurants constantly or going to bars-which leads  to  financial  troubles.  Some  have  to  spend  lots  of  money  on  health  costs because of their unhealthy lifestyle. The sage knew what he was talking about! Gluttony is also deadly because it hurts you in social contexts. Proverbs 23:1-3 says, When you sit down to dine with a ruler, consider carefully what is before you, and put a knife to your throat if you have a big appetite; don't desire his choice food, for that food is deceptive. This refers to a social context that we are unfamiliar with-eating with the royal family. But we can imagine that it would be nerve-racking! No doubt one would be tempted to overeat when presented with the delicacies that royalty can afford. But I think these verses can have application for eating with an employer today. Longman argues for a broader application as well and explains how the \"false\" food is a potential trap (Proverbs, 422-23). The food is referred to as deceptive or false  because  it  is  possibly  a  test,  or  at  least  an  opportunity  for  the  ruler  to discern the young man's character. The ruler-or boss-may be observing to see if  the  young  man  lacks  self-control  and  cannot  be  trusted  with  key  matters,  so the  scarfed-down  meal  ends  up  ruining  the  career  of  the  young  man  (Waltke, Proverbs,  Chapters  15-31, 238-39). If he overindulges it could be a sign to the king that his appetites are uncontrolled and therefore he cannot really be trusted. That would also be something a boss might observe at a business lunch. Are you able to  restrain  yourself,  or  do  you  seek  immediate  or  over-gratification?  If  you cannot  control  yourself,  it  might  cost  you  the  trust  of  your  boss  or  a  possible promotion.  The  sage  says  if  you  struggle  in  this  area,  take  drastic  measures  to control it. "}
{"Page": 254, "Info": "I think it can have even broader application. Don't have eyes that are too big. You  sit  down  to  eat  and  you  are  starving,  so  you  order  way  too  much.  My  ( Jon's) dad always used to get onto me about that. Be self-controlled at meals and enjoy them in moderation, or it will hurt you in social relationships. Theses verses also seem to indicate that an uncontrolled appetite for delicacies can be a form of gluttony-that is, eating food that is too rich. You have a taste for the best, most expensive foods. As the saying goes, \"You eat like a king.\" These verses say that gluttony is to be taken so seriously that you take drastic measures  to  avoid  it,  like  stabbing  a  knife  into  your  own  gullet!  Jesus  says something  very  similar  about  lust-gouge  out  your  eye  (Matt  5:29).  It  is  a hyperbole  that  urges  you  to  do  whatever  it  takes  to  curb  your  tendency  to overindulge. Another  reason  that  gluttony  is  deadly  is  because  it  will  make  you  sick. Proverbs  25:16  says,  \"If  you  find  honey,  eat  only  what  you  need;  otherwise, you'll get sick from it and vomit.\" The principle of this verse applies to all food (Longman, Proverbs, 455). Eating in moderation is good, but if you eat more than you  need  or  too  many  sweets,  you  can  get  sick.  Contrary  to  what  the \"theologian\" Alan Jackson says, too much of a good thing is a not a good thing. If  you  eat  too  much  you  will  be  uncomfortable,  feeling  like  you  have  a cinderblock in your chest because you are so overstuffed. You might vomit. You certainly run into health risks, as seen above. The key is knowing when to stop and having the control to be able to do it. Everybody is different, so eating \"what you  need\"  is  an  important  clarification.  That  requires  discernment  because  it may be different from what someone else needs. The problem here is that we train ourselves to be gluttons. The first time you eat  two  Big  Macs  you  might  feel  sick.  And  you  will  probably  feel  sick  the second  and  third  times,  but  by  the  seventh  time  you  get  used  to  it.  Instead  of keeping on until you can handle the gluttony, you need to know when to stop! Proverbs  28:7  says,  \"A  discerning  son  keeps  the  law,  but  a  companion  of gluttons humiliates his father.\" Let's pick this verse apart. Keeping the Torah is equated  with  wisdom  in  the  Bible  (Deut  4:6).  God  gives  us  commands  for  a reason-he  knows  what  is  best  for  us,  so  following  them  is  wise.  The  law commands  moderation  rather  than  a  lack  of  self-control  when  it  comes  to  our diet, and it does so for our good. The lines of this verse are parallel. Therefore, a wise son keeps the law and does not associate with gluttons, whereas a foolish son  breaks  the  law  and  associates  with  gluttons,  thus  dishonoring  his  family. You disobey God's law if you are a glutton, which is implied by the fact that the "}
{"Page": 255, "Info": "foolish  son  associates  with  them.  The  wages  of  gluttony  according  the  law  is death. If a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father or mother and doesn't listen to them even after they discipline him, his father and mother are to take hold of him and bring him to the elders of his city, to the gate of his hometown. They will say to the elders of his city, \"This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he doesn't obey us. He's a glutton and a drunkard.\" Then all the men of his city will stone him to death. You must purge the evil from you, and all Israel will hear and be afraid. (Deut 21:18-21) God's apparent abhorrence for gluttony is bad news for us because we have all fallen  short  here.  Who  has  not  eaten  more  than  they  should?  And  it  is  deadly. Gratifying our appetites is disastrous and condemnable. Jesus Can Free Us from Overindulgence PROVERBS 23:20-21 Gluttony is a spiritual issue, not merely a physical one. Proverbs 9 has shown us that  wisdom  is  personal.  Whether  or  not  you  walk  in  the  wisdom  of  Proverbs reveals whether or not you are following Jesus. And foolishness is personal. If you  walk  in  foolishness,  it  reveals  that  you  are  following  idols.  Gluttony  or drunkenness reveals that you have a problem with Jesus and shows that you are following Folly! If you have a relationship with the Wisdom of God-Jesus-it means Jesus's Spirit lives inside of you. The fruit that Jesus's Spirit produces in you includes self-control (Gal 5:22-23). If you have no self-control in the area of sex, food, or drink, it shows you are not following Jesus-not believing the gospel rightly. It is  a  worship  issue.  You  find  your  satisfaction  in  created  things  rather  than  the Creator God. That is why Paul describes idolatry as worshiping the stomach as a god (Phil 3:19). You live to eat instead of eat to live. Paul says the destiny for that is destruction. Since gluttony is a worship or belief issue, it cannot be dealt with merely at the level of behavior modification. There is some value in modifying behavior. Go on a diet, start exercising, and eat smaller portions. But you have to go further than that because without right belief the change will be short lived. That is why so many make New Year's resolutions to go on a diet and start working out, but by February the treadmill is already collecting dust in the corner. Our failure should drive us to Jesus and satisfaction in him. Jesus knew when to  fast  in  the  wilderness,  when  to  feast  at  the  wedding  in  Cana,  and  how  to balance!  Jesus  perfectly  kept  this  law  because  he  knew  man  does  not  live  by bread alone but by the Word of God. His appetites did not control him; rather, he "}
{"Page": 256, "Info": "controlled his appetites. In Matthew 4, when Satan tempted Jesus, he refused to give in to his hunger pangs. What is it like to be really starving and have bread at your fingertips and say, \"No!\"? Jesus had self-control. And  yet,  Jesus  was  accused  of  gluttony  and  drunkenness  because  of  his association with a certain kind of crowd. Proverbs 23:20-21 says not to associate with them, but Jesus was a friend to gluttons and drunks (that's good news for us)!  Luke  7:34  says,  \"The  Son  of  Man  has  come  eating  and  drinking,  and  you say,  \u2018Look,  a  glutton  and  a  drunkard,  a  friend  of  tax  collectors  and  sinners!'\" Jesus wrongly was accused of being the rebellious son of Deuteronomy 21, and he  was  condemned  to  death.  Jesus  took  in  our  place  the  punishment  we deserved. He was condemned by the elders and executed outside the city-hung on a tree (Deut 21:22-23). Why? Galatians 3:13 says, \"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us, because it is written, Cursed is everyone  who  is  hung  on  a  tree.\"  His  death  provides  forgiveness  for  when  we fall short, and his Spirit is given to us to produce self-control. So  the  positive  strategy  for  battling  gluttony  and  drunkenness  is  to  feast  on Jesus-the  living  water  and  bread  from  heaven.  If  you  do  that,  you  will  live forever. Satisfaction in Christ will produce self-control so you are able to have a well-balanced  diet,  feast  at  appropriate  times  as  a  means  of  worship,  and  yes, fast to show your dependence on God rather than on bread!

The Antidote to Greed Is Believing the Gospel (11:28). H e got greedy\" is a modern proverb of sorts that we use when people go for a little bit more than they should and things go bad. This kind of greed is often  easy  to  recognize  in  others,  but  it  is  hard  to  recognize  in  ourselves.  We think greed is a rich man's problem. The  Bible, however, says it is everyone's problem, including those who follow Jesus. The great Baptist preacher Charles Spurgeon  understood  this,  and  he  offered  up  this  prayer  for  himself  and  his people: O, my Lord, let me not merely talk thus, and pretend to despise earthly treasure, when all the while I am hunting after it; but grant me grace to live above these things, never setting my heart upon them, nor caring whether I have them, or have them not; but exercising all my energy in pleasing thee, and in gaining those things which thou dost hold in esteem. Give me, I pray thee, the riches of thy grace that I may at last attain to the riches of thy glory, through Christ Jesus. (Illustrations and Meditations, 263) However, that kind of attitude Spurgeon prays for is not in all of us. So often we  are  not  content  with  what  we  have.  We  want  just  a  little  bit  more.  It  starts when we are young with whatever we see on television. I ( Jon) remember my girls  seeing  a  commercial  for  \"seat  pets\"-stuffed  animals  that  connect  to  the seat belt in your car. They said, \"We have to have those!\" They had ridden in the car from place to place just fine up until then, but all of a sudden they just had to have  what  they  saw  on  TV!  The  problem  is  that  we  never  grow  out  of  that. Expenses always increase to meet the income because we want more, more, and "}
{"Page": 260, "Info": "more. We think we have to have a bigger TV, a nicer home, and a newer car. We always crave just a little more. That is why total debt has increased from about $1,200 per person in 1948 to $10,168  per  person  in  2010,  and  that  does  not  include  real  estate  debt. Americans  now  average  $3,480  in  credit  card  debt  per  person.  That  is  an increase  of  285  percent  since  1980  (Indiviglio,  \"Americans'  Love  Affair  with Debt\").  Half  of  Americans  spend  more  than  they  make  annually  (Kavoussi, \"Half  of  Americans\").  Think  about  that.  Half  of  America  spends  more  money than they make year after year. That shows a lack of contentment with what we have and a craving for more. The problem is complicated by the fact that greed is hard to define. After all, it is not wrong in and of itself to want money, a house, provision for your family, and  other  things.  But  at  any  moment  these  desires  could  become  greed  or covetousness. John Piper defines greed as \"desiring something so much you lose your contentment in God\" (\"Future Grace, Part 5\"). Therefore, greed is thinking that you need this or that to be happy. It's thinking, \"For me to be happy I need God plus _________.\" Once you fill in that blank, you travel the road of greed into  the  world  of  unbelief.  God  is  no  longer  enough.  Jesus  no  longer  satisfies your soul. This distinction made by Piper is really important because Proverbs is not  against  money.  In  fact,  Proverbs  often  links  God's  financial  blessings  with wise behavior. But desire for more becomes a very bad thing if you love, trust, or find your satisfaction in money or things rather than in God. Greed is a temptation for all of us, and the Bible says it is deadly. Greed will destroy you. We can see this destruction all around us. The problem is that we think  we  do  not  really  struggle  with  greed  because  we  do  not  have  a  lot  of money. But the apostle Paul reminds us in 1 Timothy 6 that just to want to be rich and have stuff is deadly (v. 9). You do not have to be rich to crave riches, and a greedy heart shows a life that is walking away from satisfaction in Jesus. And what Paul tells us in the New Testament is echoed throughout the book of Proverbs-greed is deadly. We see this truth clearly in Proverbs 11:24-28. "}
{"Page": 261, "Info": "Greed Is Foolish PROVERBS 11:24-28 Proverbs  argues  that  greed  is  foolish  and  deadly,  and  you  should  be  able  to observe  that  in  everyday  life.  There  are  too  many  modern  examples  of  this  to count. Dr. Seuss's story \"The Lorax\" reveals the deadly effects of greed on the environment. The main character abuses natural resources for his own gain. Or one  can  look  at  the  economic  crisis  in  America  a  few  years  ago  and  see  how greed not only destroyed the economy but also people's lives. Greed Is Foolish Because It Hurts You (11:24-26; 28:22) Greed  hurts  us  in  all  kinds  of  ways.  Greed  might  make  you  a  workaholic  who misses out on time with family, or it might make you a miserly kind of person who refuses to be kind to others. The Bible says that kind of lifestyle will injure you personally. We see this truth in Proverbs 11:24-26. One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor. A generous person will be enriched, and the one who gives a drink of water will receive water. People will curse anyone who hoards grain, but a blessing will come to the one who sells it. These  verses  sound  counterintuitive  to  us.  We  think  that  holding  on  to  our money and stuff will mean that we have more of it, but the Bible says hoarding what  you  have  does  not  mean  more;  it  means  less.  While  it  may  seem counterintuitive,  we  can  observe  this  truth  in  nature.  Generously  sowing  seed and  generously  watering  the  ground  will  lead  to  much  fruit  (Murphy  and Huwiler,  Proverbs,  56).  Therefore,  one  major  sign  of  greed  is  hoarding  and stinginess, and that hurts you and others around you. People are even able to justify hoarding in their minds. They say things like, \"I can't tithe right now because we just bought a new house.\" But this attitude is foolish  because  the  Bible  says  it  leads  to  poverty.  Proverbs  28:22  says,  \"A greedy one is in a hurry for wealth; he doesn't know that poverty will come to him.\" We might be tempted to say, \"Is this true?\" ( Johnson, Him We Proclaim, 303- 13).39  After  all,  we  know  stories  of  greedy  misers  who  prosper  and  generous people who are poor. The point of Proverbs is that God's wisdom will work out ultimately even if it does not work out immediately in this life. There will be a "}

Ahab and Jezebel  looked  like  they  prospered  from  their  murderous  greed  for  another vineyard, but the tables turned on them in the end (1 Kgs 21; 2 Kgs 9). The rich man  in  Luke  16  prospered  while  the  poor  man  languished  with  the  stray  dogs, but in the end the poor man was comforted in paradise while the rich man was tortured  in  hades  (Luke  16:19-31).  The  consequence  of  greed  will  be  that  the poverty you dread is what you will end up with-sometimes now and sometimes later.  In  contrast,  the  generous  will  be  given  even  more.  Reject  greediness because it hurts you. Greed Is Foolish Because It Hurts the People Around You (15:7) Your desire for more hurts those around you-the people you love. Greed might cause  you  to  fail  to  meet  people's  needs  or  drive  your  family  into  the  ground. Proverbs  15:27  says,  \"Whoever  is  greedy  for  unjust  gain  troubles  his  own household\"  (ESV).  Craving  money  and  going  after  it  by  any  means  necessary always has repercussions on those closest to you. If you are a workaholic, cheat on your taxes, or misuse petty cash at work, inevitably it will have consequences on those you love. You hear story after story of people who had everything by worldly standards and were still miserable. Not only were they miserable, but so were their families. We see biblical examples of this with Achan in Joshua 7 or Ananias and Sapphira in Acts 5. Greed brought down the wrath of God. We can see modern examples of this all around us. As I ( Jon) have mentioned earlier, I had a friend in high school who was rich by the world's standards. He drove a BMW  at  age  sixteen,  but  when  I  stayed  over  at  his  house  I  noticed  his  mom would  pass  out  drunk  at  night  because  her  husband  never  came  home.  Having riches and possessions does not lead to happiness! Greed Is Foolish Because Money Doesn't Last (23:4-5) Proverbs 23:4-5 says, Don't wear yourself out to get rich; because you know better, stop! As soon as your eyes fly to it, it disappears, for it makes wings for itself and flies like an eagle to the sky. Proverbs tells us to be wise enough to exercise restraint in our pursuit for money. It does not say, \"Don't work hard,\" but rather it teaches that  there should be a rhythm of work and rest in your life. There comes a time when enough is enough (Longman, Proverbs, 424). Do not neglect your family, lose your relationships, or "}
{"Page": 263, "Info": "let  your  happiness  fluctuate  in  pursuit  of  something  that  is  fleeting.  Have  the wisdom to recognize that there are things that are more valuable than money. Do not  waste  your  life  on  things  that  do  not  last!  Money  has  wings,  and  it  flies away! Once  my  wife  and  I  (  Jon)  bought  our  daughters  butterflies  to  raise.  We  got them as caterpillars and tended to them and nurtured them until they grew to be butterflies in a net, but at some point we had to let them go. The girls were so sad because they wanted to hold on to them as long as they could, but they could not hold on to them forever. Money is the same way. The saying goes that you never see a hearse pulling a U-Haul trailer. The  fact  that  you  cannot  take  money  and  stuff  with  you  should  change  your perspective on it. Why do we spend so much energy acquiring the stuff of future garage sales? Sure, it shimmers and shines when we get it, but it fades quickly and then we think we need a new one. One big example of this is the story my youth pastor told me about taking his children to Graceland. Elvis had things in his day that were considered unbelievable and decadent. He had a television and a mobile phone in his car. My youth pastor told me when he showed those things to his young sons they were not impressed at all. They were saying, we have a mobile  phone  and  can  play  Pacman  on  it,  and  we  have  a  TV  in  our  car  and  it plays  DVDs.  Elvis's  possessions  were  so  exceptional  and  valuable  at  the  time, but  now  they  have  lost  their  shine.  That  is  why  Jesus  says  that  moths  and  rust will destroy the things that we work so hard for, and we cannot take them with us when we die (Matt 6:19-21). Greed Is Deadly Because It Is Unbelief PROVERBS 11:28; 28:25 Proverbs  11:28  says,  \"Anyone  trusting  in  his  riches  will  fall,  but  the  righteous will flourish like foliage.\" Greed is trusting in and finding happiness in money rather than in God. The problem is not wealth but rather our attitude toward it. The  parallelism  of  this  verse  implies  that  the  person  who  relies  on  wealth  is unrighteous. How then do you assess whether or not you are trusting in wealth? Ask  questions  like,  \"Does  my  joy  or  anxiety  rise  and  fall  with  my  bank statement? Am I constantly anxious about money and provision?\" The answers to those questions might reveal you have made money or stuff an idol. If your joy  is  determined  by  your  money  and  possessions,  you  are  falsely  worshiping something  other  than  God.  If  you  are  constantly  anxious  about  provision,  it reveals that you believe you need something other than God to be happy. When "}
{"Page": 264, "Info": "money and stuff are seen as the path to a happy life, you are in idolatry. Jesus says that you cannot serve both God and money (Matt 6:24), and Solomon says the exact same thing. We  see  the  contrast  between  greed  and  belief  again  in  Proverbs  28:25:  \"A greedy  person  stirs  up  conflict,  but  whoever  trusts  in  the  LORD  will  prosper.\" Here's  the  bottom  line:  those  who  are  greedy  do  not  trust  God.  They  trust  in money instead  of Jesus. That reality is why  Jesus said that it is hard for a  rich man to enter the kingdom of God (Matt 19:23). The rich do not see their need for God.  In  contrast,  those  who  trust  the  Lord  are  content,  they  do  not  grasp  for other things to make them happy, and they wait for the true blessings that come from God alone. Trusting in money and possessions will send you to hell because it is unbelief, and we are only saved by grace through faith. Proverbs 11:4 states, \"Wealth is not profitable on a day of wrath, but righteousness rescues from death.\" God's wrath will be poured out on the greedy. We will stand before a judge who has access to the hidden cravings of our hearts. On that day, what will it profit you to gain the whole world and lose your soul (Mark 8:36)? It's not just that greed will cause things to go badly for you in this life, although it will; but even more than that, greed will send you to hell. The Antidote to Greed Is Believing the Gospel PROVERBS 11:28 Here's  the  bottom  line:  greed  is  a  belief  and  worship  issue.  You  believe  and worship your way into greed, and you must believe and worship your way out of it.  It's  not  just  that  greed  makes  you  a  Mr.  Scrooge;  it's  that  greed  shows  that you  are  walking  away  from  Jesus,  the  Wisdom  of  God.  Proverbs  reveals  that foolishness is idolatry, and thus the foolishness of greed reveals a heart that does not believe or follow Jesus. Jesus perfectly avoided greed; he was never greedy, even one time. Satan tried to bribe Jesus with the kingdoms of the world if he would bypass the cross and its  suffering,  but  Jesus  perfectly  controlled  his  appetite  and  refused  idolatry. Everything he refused from Satan-and more-was given to him by God later. After all, after his resurrection from the dead he looked at his disciples and said, \"All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth\" (Matt 28:18). Jesus refused the fleeting pleasures of this life so that he could enjoy eternal ones. He knew what we do not seem to understand-our cravings will never be satisfied "}
{"Page": 265, "Info": "in this life. Man does not live by bread or flat screen TV alone; he lives by God alone (Matt 4:4). Even  though  Jesus  was  never  greedy,  he  died  because  of  the  greedy  and  for the  greedy.  Judas's  greed  for  silver  led  him  to  betray  Jesus  and  enrich  himself (Matt  26:15).  And  yet,  if  you  only  look  at  the  death  of  Jesus  from  a  short perspective, you might be led to ask, Is Proverbs right? The greedy person was enriched  while  the  generous  person  was  killed.  But  from  the  post-resurrection perspective,  we  see  that  by  Sunday  morning  the  tables  had  turned- righteousness delivered Jesus from death! Jesus,  through  his  death,  provides  forgiveness  and  salvation  to  those  who repent  of  greed  and  believe  in  him.  He  also  grants  his  perfect  record  of contentment  to  those  who  believe  in  him.  If  you  are  in  Christ,  this  is  who  you are: the perfectly content son or daughter of God. Now live like it! Jesus,  through  his  gospel,  now  empowers  us  to  be  content  and  generous people.  The  promises  of  money  are  powerful,  and  they  are  only  broken  by  the power of the gospel's superior promises-like the fact that God is now for you and no good thing will he withhold from you (Ps 84:11). Do you believe that? Believing that is the means to be content and generous. According  to  Hebrews  13:5-6,  the  only  way  you  will  be  content  is  if  you believe that God is for you: Keep your life free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for he himself has said, I will never leave you or abandon you. Therefore, we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can man do to me? If you are not content, it is because you do not trust God to help you. This is a belief issue. You do not trust that your God will supply all your needs according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus (Phil 4:19). But when you place your trust in God and find your satisfaction in him alone, you can be content with what you have and praise God for what he has given you. Not  only  does  the  gospel  lead  you  to  be  content  with  what  you  have,  it  also leads you to be generous toward others. Second Corinthians 8:9 says, \"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich, for your sake he became poor, so that by his poverty you might become rich.\" The gospel turns us from takers and hoarders into generous and joyful givers because what we have in Christ is vastly superior to material riches. When God got hold of my dad, he (Danny) sold his car to give more money to the church. You do not have to be rich to be generous; you just have to be changed by Jesus. I remember leading a young couple to the Lord who had nothing and barely scraped by, but they gave "}

{"Page": 268, "Info": "Lust PROVERBS 23:26-28 Main Idea: The antidote to lust is the gospel of Jesus Christ. I. Lust Will Ruin Your Life. II. The Gospel Will Save Your Life. W hen people go deer hunting, they put out bait to lure the deer in and they put  on  camouflage  to  disguise  themselves  so  the  deer  cannot  see  them. The  deer  is  not  suspecting  anything  as  it  walks  toward  what  looks  like  a  good meal; then BAM! it gets shot through the heart. As graphic as that image might seem, that is exactly the picture that Proverbs paints when it comes to the issue of lust. You are prey being hunted down by a predator. This wisdom principle is observable. Even non-Christians can sense this truth. I once counseled with an atheist who lost his marriage because of pornography. He  and  his  wife  were  not  believers  and  did  not  have  the  ethical  code  of  the Bible, but his uncontrolled lust for pornography still destroyed his marriage and brought  great  devastation  into  his  life.  He,  an  unbeliever,  saw  up  close  and personal the horrible consequences of uncontrolled lust. Lust is deadly for all of us! Lust is a predator stalking its victim, and we must be able to see it. The problem is that we are often like that deer that does not see the danger until it is too late. Granted, some of you do see it, but the only reason you  see  it  is  because  it  has  already  ruined  you  or  gotten  its  clutches  into  you. Others of you do not think you have a problem with lust because you do not act on it, but Jesus says it is not just the act of sexual sin that condemns us. It is also the desire for sinful sex that condemns us. That is why Albert Mohler Jr. has said that everyone north of puberty is a sexual sinner.40 Some of you fool yourselves into thinking that you are safe because your fantasies stay in your mind, but the Bible  says  that  sexual  sin  starts  with  lust  in  your  heart  and  mind.  Even  if  you have never acted out in a sinful sexual way, you have thought about it and are therefore guilty of it. Some people do not see how right now they are taking small steps in this area that  will  ultimately  destroy  their  life.  Some  are  training  themselves  for destruction right now and think it is no big deal. They think to themselves things "}
{"Page": 269, "Info": "like, \"I just look at porn occasionally.\" \"It's not hurting anyone.\" \"I don't have a problem.\" \"What's the big deal if I make out with my girlfriend?\" \"What's the big  deal  in  giving  an  iPhone  to  my  twelve-year-old?\"  Some  folks  are  setting patterns in their lives right now-or in the lives of their children-that will cause them to do something one year, three years, or fifteen years from now that their children will remember at a funeral service. Sexual lust is not something to play with; it is deadly! Proverbs 23:26-28 says, My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. For a prostitute is a deep pit, and a wayward woman is a narrow well; indeed, she sets an ambush like a robber and increases the number of unfaithful people. "}
{"Page": 270, "Info": "Lust Will Ruin Your Life God  gave  sex  as  a  good  gift  to  be  enjoyed  in  the  context  of  the  covenant commitment  called  \"marriage.\"  However,  in  our  sinfulness  we  distort  God's good  gift  and  use  it  in  ways  he  forbids.  He  forbids  those  ways  not  because  he wants to rob us of fun but because he knows that using sex in a way that he did not design is harmful and destructive. This includes all sexual activity outside of heterosexual  marriage.  All  of  it.  So  God  warns  us  about  sexual  sin  and  lust because enjoying sexual pleasure in the wrong context is deadly.41 The sage says, \"My son, give me your heart,\" because he knows-like Jesus- that  lust  starts  in  the  heart.  Purity  of  heart  is  the  goal  because  it  will  lead  to  a pure  life.  As  Proverbs  4:23  has  already  told  us,  your  heart  determines  your behavior, so you cannot simply modify your behavior. If you are not pure at the heart level, you will find new outlets for your sin. For example, without a pure heart, you might put blocking software on your computer, but you will find ways around  it,  or  you  will  just  fantasize  in  your  own  mind.  The  battle  against  lust must be fought in the mind and heart because that is where this all starts. That is its origin. Then  the  sage  moves  from  the  heart  to  the  eyes  because  a  lustful  heart  will drive  eyes  to  look  at  things  they  should  not  look  at.  We  cannot  tell  you  how many  people  are  killing  themselves  with  pornography.  They  are  warping  their minds to view sexuality in a purely selfish and corrupt manner. This selfish view of sex destroys marriages and will destroy future marriages because the viewer's mind is twisted by pornographic images into seeing intimacy as something other than what it is, something other than God designed and intended. Looking at all kinds  of  things  can  drive  lust:  Internet  porn,  the  wrong  movies,  the  wrong sitcoms,  the  Sports  Illustrated  swimsuit  edition,  or  just  checking  out  women  at  the mall. The sage says to the son, \"Observe my ways.\" Imitate me. Can we say that? What  if  your  son  or  daughter  grew  up  to  think  just  like  you?  Would  that  be good?  Can  you  urge  them  to  imitate  you?  Or  is  the  fact  that  you  check  out women in public or talk about the beauty of other women, thereby putting down your wife's beauty, leading your son to death? I once ministered to a family with a young son who they would take to Hooters and get his picture taken with all the waitresses surrounding him. They would post his big smile on Facebook, but they did not understand the view of women and sexuality that they were planting "}
{"Page": 271, "Info": "in his mind with pictures that they thought were innocently cute. God designed sex for other-ness, not selfishness. Solomon constantly warns his son on this specific topic because this is where Solomon fell and was destroyed (see 1 Kgs 11). He repeatedly said, \"Listen to me,\" and warned his son of the wayward (foreign?) woman who leads to sexual sin.  Here  in  Proverbs  23  the  sage  again  warns  that  the  immoral  woman-a metaphor  for  sexual  sin  and  lust-is  a  deep  pit!  The  image  is  clear.  Hunters would  dig  out  deep  pits  in  an  attempt  to  trap  their  prey.  They  would  then camouflage the hole so that their  prey would not see it and would fall into the trap. That is what sexual lust does. Also,  the  pit  is  a  metaphor  for  physical  and  spiritual  death.  Proverbs  talks about Sheol, or the grave, when it talks about the pit (Prov 5; 7; 9). Sexual lust will  send  you  to  hell.  Sexual  sin  and  lust  is  an  enemy.  Lust  is  a  huntress  or robber who wants to kill you and take everything you have. Just like the hunter's prey, you often do not see the trap until it is too late. Proverbs has told us repeatedly that wisdom is not a set of ideas; Wisdom is a person. And the New Testament tells us that person is Jesus. But Proverbs also reveals that Folly is a person. Satan stands behind the wayward woman-sexual sin-seeking to kill you. The enemy is prowling around setting a trap to destroy you and take you to hell. How does he do it? He does it through things that are seductive and appealing. Satan is tracking you down, and he notices the things that turn you on, just as a hunter notices what bait attracts the deer. Lust traps you and ruins your life. It is a waste of time and resources. It warps your idea of marriage. And it puts in place a pattern of behavior that in the future will cause you to hurt your spouse and betray your family. That is what verse 28 says.  The  predator  increases  the  number  of  unfaithful  people.  So  lust  will  ruin you. It will damage your reputation, or it will cause you to lose your family or your  future  family.  Sexual  sin  is  a  break  of  the  marriage  covenant,  even  your future marriage covenant. Goldsworthy points out that this verse refers to those who are unfaithful in marriage (Tree of Life, 155). The sage says that sexual sin is a pit. He said it earlier about the adulteress's mouth in 22:14: \"The mouth of the forbidden woman is a deep pit; a man cursed by the LORD will fall into it.\" What does this refer to? The mouth is what often leads men and women astray (cf. Prov 5; 7). Flattery appeals to a man's vanity (Longman,  Proverbs,  408),  and  words  appeal  to  a  woman's  desire  for  intimate conversation. Sexual sin offers you pleasure, and it delivers for a little while. But "}
{"Page": 272, "Info": "then you realize too late that you fell into a trap. After all, Proverbs 7 and 9 say this woman's house leads down to the grave. Interestingly, falling for this kind of sin will not just earn you future judgment; it is a sign of God's condemnation right now (22:14). A sign of God's judgment is  the  fact  that  he  is  handing  you  over  to  your  fleshly  desires.  He  removes  his merciful, restraining hand from you. Not being able to control yourself, loathing yourself  because  one  more  time  you  have  deleted  the  Internet  history  on  your computer,  losing  your  family  because  of  pornography  addiction-these  are  all just a foretaste of the judgment that is to come. The  problem  is  that  we  are  all  predisposed  to  this  and  have  fallen  short  of God's glory in this area. It starts out small and sometimes seemingly innocent, but then BAM! you fall. All along you did not see how you were undermining your  marriage  or  your  future  marriage.  You  thought  it  was  harmless.  You thought you had not really done anything \"sinful,\" but you did not see how you were  driving  a  wedge  into  your  marriage.  You  thought  things  like,  \"It's  just  a little flirting. So what? He makes me feel appreciated in a way I don't at home.\" \"What's the big deal? I'd never really do anything anyway.\" \"She laughs at my jokes.\"  \"He's  a  better  listener  than  my  husband.\"  Those  thoughts,  even unconsciously, plant a deadly germ in your marriage. Facebook can be a big killer because you start to wonder about an old flame and  what  it  would  have  been  like  if  you  had  ended  up  together.  Now  you  can attempt to recreate what you once had. For some women it is reading romance novels  that  make  them  desire  intimacy  with  someone  else.  For  some  there  are struggles  with  modesty,  causing  others  to  stumble.  For  teens  it  might  be  when they ponder, How far is too far? If you ask that question, it shows that you do not understand that you are training yourself to enjoy sexual contact outside of the covenant of marriage and you are cheating on your future spouse. So parents, it is foolish to let your kids be alone with someone of the opposite sex. Again,  we  do  not  see  how  deadly  some  things,  that  we  think  are  innocuous, actually  are.  I  (  Jon)  once  counseled  with  a  couple  where  the  husband  had cheated on the wife. They were trying to put their marriage back together; and as I dug into their issues, they told me that they used to watch pornography together to spice up their marriage. I asked them why in the world they would do such a thing. I looked at the wife and said, \"Don't you see that you are training him to be aroused by a woman that is not you? Is it any wonder that he went out of the marriage with another woman?\" Often, the things that we think are not that big a deal are the things that destroy us. "}
{"Page": 273, "Info": "Proverbs  30:20  says  of  the  adulteress,  \"This  is  the  way  of  an  adulteress:  she eats and wipes her mouth and says, \u2018I've done nothing wrong.'\" What this verse means  is  that  we  find  a  way  to  justify  our  sexual  sin.  Some  people  justify themselves  because  their  spouse  isn't  \"holding  up  their  end  of  the  marriage.\" Some  will  even  justify  their  sexual  sin  by  saying  it  is  God's  will.  I  (  Jon) remember riding to my brother's basketball game with his roommate's mother, who had stolen her best friend's husband. She left her second marriage to begin a relationship with her best friend's husband, and she said to me, \"I finally found the person that God has for me.\" We try to downplay and justify our lust and our sexual sin, but the Bible says they are deadly. The sexually immoral will not inherit the kingdom of God. So the  question  asked  by  Tim  Challies  is  a  good  one:  \"Do  you  love  pornography enough to go to hell for it?\" (\"Desecration and Titillation\"). And we might add, Do you love lust enough to go to hell for it? The Gospel Will Save Your Life Folly-Satan-wants you to follow him to hell. So the sage constantly warns us not to fall for lust because if you do, you are following Folly toward death. On the  flip  side,  Jesus  is  the  Wisdom  of  God  and  wants  you  to  follow  him  on  the path of life and wisdom. If you are falling into lust, it shows you have a problem with  Jesus-that  is,  you  do  not  believe  the  gospel  rightly,  even  if  you  are  a Christian. In  Tim  Challies's  article,  he  makes  a  great  argument  (\"Desecration  and Titillation\"). God gave humanity a picture of the gospel long before Jesus died and  rose  again  when  he  gave  us  the  institution  of  marriage  (Gen  2;  Eph  5). Marriage is meant to point us to the relationship of Christ with his church. Our marriages should picture this: Christ's pure love for his bride that drove him to the  cross  to  be  united  with  her  in  one  flesh.  Sexual  union  is  only  right  in marriage  because  only  then  can  it  point  to  the  intimate  love  Christ  has  for  his people. Sex outside of marriage-lust-lies about Jesus and the church. It makes a  mockery  of  the  gospel.  \"To  tamper  with  sex  is  to  tamper  with  the  death  and resurrection of Jesus Christ\" (Challies, \"Desecration and Titillation\"). When you look  at  pornography,  fantasize,  or  flirt  with  a  coworker,  you  are  mocking  the gospel.  In  pornography,  you  are  watching  a  violation  of  the  gospel  and  being turned on by it. In contrast, a pure sexual relationship in marriage points to the purity of Jesus's love for you. So when you lust you are saying that you need a "}
{"Page": 274, "Info": "more satisfying and pleasurable love than the love of Jesus. That shows you have not rightly grasped the gospel. Therefore,  Proverbs  tells  us  that  the  horizontal  antidote  to  lust  is  marriage. Enjoy  exclusive  and  repeated  intimacy  with  your  spouse  rather  than  burn  with lust. So guys, romance your wife, learn about her, become an expert on her, do getaway weekends without the kids, do not sleep in separate rooms, and pursue her your entire life. If you are not regularly intimate with your wife, Paul says you are  in  a  danger  zone.  After  all,  he  mentions  the  same  predators  seeking  to destroy marriage as Proverbs (1 Cor 7). The  vertical  antidote  to  lust  is  Jesus  and  the  gospel.  Preach  the  gospel  to yourself  daily.  Fight  this  war  in  your  heart  and  mind.  John  Piper  talks  about imagining graphic images of Jesus dying on the cross-head pierced by thorns, lacerated back heaving up and down on the cross beam, and lungs struggling for breath-as you quote Titus 2:14: \"He gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works.\" He did that for our purity; and if we yield to lust, we add to his already  excruciating  suffering  by  stabbing  him  with  a  sword.  Because  he  died for our purity, we should not do that (Piper, \"Future Grace, Part 4\"). The sage warns us through the Spirit about lust, and we are called to heed the warnings and walk in wisdom-following after Jesus. That means gouging out your eye instead of going to hell (Matt 5:29). Flee from lust and do not even get close  to  it  because  it  is  so  dangerous.  Do  not  see  how  far  you  can  go  or  how close  you  can  get  to  the  line.  Do  not  ask,  \"How  close  to  immorality  can  I  get without actually committing it?\" No! Run from it (1 Cor 6:18)! This might mean a community group where you are accountable to other guys, blocking software, joining a reporting program like Covenant Eyes, getting rid of your computer, or throwing your kids' iPhone in the trash. It means doing whatever you have to do. You might say, \"Oh that's a bit much,\" but not if you look at it this way: there is a  ferocious  predator  loose  in  your  house  trying  to  kill  you,  and  it  only  makes sense to take drastic measures to take its life before it takes yours.

The  good  news  is  that  Jesus  went  into  the  pit  for  you-he became the prey-and he came back alive on the other side. He crushed the head of the predator and offers you forgiveness and new life if you will turn to him. One day those things that you think no one else knows about will be uncovered, and you will have to look a man in the face who knows not only everything you have  ever  done  but  also  everything  you  have  ever  thought.

{"Page": 277, "Info": "Pride PROVERBS 16:18-20 Main Idea: The antidote to destructive pride is trust in Jesus. I. Prideful Trust of Self Is Foolish and Destructive (28:26). II. Humbly Follow God and His Word (15:31-33; 16:18-20; 30:1-6). III. Humbly Follow Godly Instruction and Counsel (10:8). T he prevailing idea of our pop culture is \"Follow your heart, and you can't go  wrong.\"  From  Disney  movies  to  The  Bachelor,  we  are  told  to  follow  our hearts  in  order  to  make  the  best  decisions  for  our  lives.  Whom  should  I  date? Whom  should  I  marry?  Should  I  stay  married?  What  career  path  should  I choose? To answer those kinds of questions, you just need to ask, What does my heart tell me? Even \"Christian\" counsel often seems to be a mix of Bible verses and \"follow your heart.\" Be true to you, or be true to who God made you to be- however you might define that-and things will always work out. Such counsel is foolish. Charles Spurgeon was spot on: \"The heart is a den of evil\"  (\"Meeting  of  the  Neighboring  Churches\").  Left  to  ourselves,  we  choose wrongly because we have sinful hearts. We do not see the world rightly, so we make decisions that ruin our lives. Proverbs reveals that wisdom and foolishness basically boil down to two issues of the heart: humility and pride. Those who are prideful and trust in themselves for decision making will fall, but those who are humble and trust in the Lord for decision making will be wise. Everything can boil down to pride and humility (16:18-20). Prideful Trust of Self Is Foolish and Destructive PROVERBS 28:26 The  world  calls  us  to  pride  and  self-exaltation,  but  the  Bible  warns  us  about these  companion  sins.  While  the  Disney  Channel  tells  you  to  rely  on  yourself and  follow  your  heart,  the  Bible  says  that  is  foolishness.  Proverbs  28:26  says, \"Whoever trusts in his own heart is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered\" (author's translation). The reason it is wrong to pridefully follow your heart is because your heart is sinful. Proverbs 20:9 asks, \"Who can say, \u2018I have kept  my  heart  pure;  I  am  cleansed  from  my  sin'?\"  The  rhetorical  question  is "}
{"Page": 278, "Info": "posed in such a way that the expected answer is, no one! (Waltke, Proverbs, Chapters 15-31,  135).  Because  of  our  sinful  and  impure  condition,  we  do  not  choose rightly.  We  do  not  see  things  clearly,  and  therefore  following  our  hearts  is deadly  because  we  will  not  be  \"delivered\"  (i.e.,  saved).  A  pride  that  thinks  we are always right and does not see things for the way they really are is a deadly thing. Even  though  our  pride  clouds  our  vision  of  the  world,  there  are  still  some wisdom  patterns  that  we  can  see  in  our  sinful  condition,  such  as  the  fact  that laziness  generally  leads  to  poverty.  However,  there  are  things  that  are  wise  to God that are foolishness to men, and there are things that are foolishness to God that we think are wise (see 1 Cor 1). Our logic is contaminated by sin, folly, and pride; and the biggest problem is that we cannot even see it. The wisdom of this age makes sense to us because it's all we know. Therefore, it's difficult for us to know  what  is  truly  wise  and  right  in  life.  We  pridefully  think  our  view  is  the correct one. There are plenty of examples where being wise in God's eyes will require the humility  to  look  strange  in  the  world's  eyes.  The  world  says  you  should  sleep with your girlfriend before you marry her. After all, how else will you know if you  like  being  romantic  with  her?  God  says  that's  destructive,  and  we  can observe that in the pain that many experience as a result of premarital sex or in the higher divorce rate among those who live together before marriage. Still, we choose to ignore the evidence. Or the world says to get what you want now and pay  for  it  later.  Spend  money  you  don't  have!  But  God  says  that  is  foolish. Again, we can see that with the massive credit card debt of our culture and the heavy burden it brings. We choose to ignore the evidence because our hearts are sinful, broken, and prideful. God's wisdom clashes with the wisdom of the world. Worldly wisdom says, \"If you want to be rich, you need to be stingy and keep things for yourself.\" But godly wisdom says, \"One person gives freely, yet gains more; another withholds what is right, only to become poor\" (11:24). Worldly wisdom says, \"If someone wrongs  you,  get  back  at  them,  hold  a  grudge,  or  revel  in  their  failures.\"  But godly wisdom says, \"Don't gloat when your enemy falls\" (24:17) and, \"If your enemy  is  hungry,  give  him  food  to  eat\"  (25:21).  Do  good  to  your  enemy! Worldly  wisdom  says,  \"Money  will  make  you  happy,  so  get  as  much  as  you can.\"  But  godly  wisdom  says,  \"Anyone  trusting  in  his  riches  will  fall\"  (11:28) and, \"A righteous person eats until he is satisfied\" (13:25). Be content with what you  have!  God  says  that  often  you  will  be  happier  with  less:  \"Better  is  a  little "}
{"Page": 279, "Info": "with  the  fear  of  the  LORD  than  great  treasure  with  turmoil\"  (15:16).  While  the world calls us to chase money with all we have, we can observe that riches often bring great sadness. As Matt Chandler said, \"I've never met someone who came from a really poor background whose parents loved them and were around a lot, who was really bitter about the fact they drove a trashy car. . . . But I have met devastated  young  men  and  women  with  very  expensive  cars  and  very  nice clothes whose daddy and mommy was [sic] never around\" (\"Mission of God\"). The  world  says,  \"If  you  want  to  get  ahead  in  life,  you  need  to  promote yourself.\"  But  God  says,  \"Let  another  praise  you,  and  not  your  own  mouth\" (27:2). The world says, \"Be buddies with your kids. Don't discipline them or say no  to  them.  You  don't  want  them  to  be  maladjusted,  do  you?\"  But  God  says, \"The  one  who  loves  [his  son]  disciplines  him  diligently\"  (13:24).  The  world says, \"Follow your heart when it comes to dating, the friends you have, the style of clothes you wear, or the lifestyle you lead. Don't listen to your parents or your pastors. Be yourself!\" Proverbs says that listening to your heart is foolish. You need  to  submit  to  your  parents  and  listen  to  godly  counsel.  Worldly  wisdom says,  \"Go  along  to  get  along.  Don't  jeopardize  friendships  by  having  difficult conversations; it's not your business anyway.\" But godly wisdom says, \"Better an  open  reprimand  than  concealed  love\"  (27:5).  God  tells  us  these  things because he loves us. Some of the things the world tells us-if we take a step back-are easily seen as  foolish,  but  others  are  not.  We  cannot  see  how  bragging  is  self-destructive, but  God  says  these  things  are  foolish  and  will  be  called  to  account.  Our  big problem  is  not  a  lack  of  information  but  rather  that  we  do  not  see  the  world rightly because of our heart condition; and the even bigger problem is that we do not  even  know  it!  We  are  wise  in  our  own  eyes,  and  Proverbs  says  that  is  the epitome of foolishness (21:2). Foolishness is a lot like colorblindness, and I know a lot about colorblindness because  I  (  Jon)  am  struck  with  this  malady.  At  my  house,  one  of  our  girls' favorite  games  is  to  hold  up  items  and  ask  daddy,  \"What  color  is  this?\"  while they  giggle  uncontrollably  when  I  cannot  answer!  I  cannot  see  colors  rightly (neither can two of my brothers)-they look different to me than to most people. Proverbs says that is how foolishness is. You are not able to see things the way they really are. You cannot perceive the right order of things. For example, all of us have watched movies or sitcoms on network TV that our grandparents would have  considered  hardcore  pornography.  We  don't  consider  them  hardcore because we have grown up in a culture where seeing skin, lots of skin, does not "}
{"Page": 280, "Info": "shock us (Moore, Walking the Line). We are self-deceived and cannot see that we are thinking  wrongly;  so  we  go  against  the  grain  of  how  God  designed  the  world, and we hurt ourselves and often others as well. \"There is a way that seems right to a person, but its end is the way to death\" (14:12; 16:25). What seems like the right course to you actually will lead you to ruin and death because you are not seeing things clearly. Left to ourselves, we will  pridefully  choose  the  wrong  way.  Proverbs  says,  \"Foolishness  is  bound  to the heart of a youth\" (22:15). Anyone who has children knows that this is true. A parent does not have to teach their kids to be stingy with their toys, but they do have  to  teach  them  to  share.  Wise  choices-like  sharing-do  not  come  to  us naturally.  That is  true for  children, but  it  is also  true for  adults.  We  are just  as self-deceived.  As  Proverbs  says,  \"A  fool's  way  is  right  in  his  own  eyes,  but whoever  listens  to  counsel  is  wise\"  (12:15).  It  is  foolish  to  think  your  way  is always  right  and  not  to  listen  to  counsel  in  your  life,  whether  it  comes  from  a parent, a pastor, or a godly friend. But again, wisdom requires humility whereas foolishness is the pride that refuses to submit to counsel. We need to be called away from pride-trusting in ourselves-to trusting the Lord. Proverbs 3:5 says, \"Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not rely on your own understanding.\" These are two sides of the same coin: trust God not yourself, walk in humility not pride. \"Don't be wise in your own eyes,\" Proverbs 3:7 states. So foolishness consists of pridefully thinking that you are wise or that your way is always right; it's a lack of humility. This  kind  of  pride  and  self-deception  is  deadly  dangerous.  Proverbs  26:12 asks, \"Do you see a person who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.\" Wow! You are worse than a fool if you are cocky enough to think you are wise. You push back because you are sure that you are right, and you hurt yourself in the process: your plans fail because you did not seek advice, you  wreck  your  family  because  you  thought  it  was  OK  to  step  out  on  your marriage, you run your family into the ground because you thought life was all about money, or your kids are out of control because you thought discipline was outdated. If you trust yourself or you care too much about what others think of you, it can ruin your life. Proverbs 29:25 says, \"The fear of mankind is a snare, but the one who trusts in the LORD is protected.\" If you fear man rather than God -if  you  want  to  be  liked  and  accepted  too  much-it  will  lead  to  foolish  and harmful decisions. So  if  pride  is  essentially  the  epitome  of  foolishness,  how  and  where  do  we look for wisdom in decision making? "}
{"Page": 281, "Info": "Humbly Follow God and His Word PROVERBS 15:31-33; 16:18-20; 30:1-6 Proverbs as a whole, and Proverbs 16 in particular, tells us that wisdom is found in  humbly  trusting  God.  After  all,  he  made  the  world,  and  he  knows  how  it works. Proverbs encourages us to look to God and his Word for wisdom. If one were to boil down the message of Proverbs, it might look like this: \"Trust God, not yourself!\" Or \"Be humble, not prideful.\" This is what Solomon means when he  says  that  the  fear  of  the  Lord  is  the  key  component  to  wisdom  (1:7;  9:10; etc.). What does that mean? It means that there are two components to gaining wisdom: humbly look away from yourself, and look to God and his Word. The fear  of  Yahweh  is  reverent  awe  and  dependence  on  him-as  he  has  revealed himself  in  his  Word-that  leads  to  obeying  him.  This  is  a  healthy  fear  of  him who can cast both soul and body into hell (Matt 10:28). True wisdom entails the humility to know that you do not know it all! So if the boiled-down message of Proverbs is to trust God with all your heart and  not  lean  on  your  own  understanding,  then  this  requires  humility,  which  is almost  synonymous  in  Proverbs  with  the  fear  of  Yahweh  (see  15:31-33).  The first  step  to  wisdom  is  to  realize  that  you  are  not  wise.  In  order  to  have knowledge, you  must  first  recognize  that  you  do  not  know  everything  and  you are  not  always  right.  Wisdom  is  being  humble  enough  to  admit  that,  and  then submitting  yourself  to  God  and  wise  counsel.  Proverbs  9:8-10  says  that  when you correct a wise man he will be wiser still. This means that you never arrive at the  point  where  you  are  so  wise  that  you  do  not  need  to  humble  yourself  to correction. On the other hand, pride is the essence of foolishness in many ways. Proverbs  11:2  states,  \"When  arrogance  comes,  disgrace  follows;  but  with humility  comes  wisdom,\"  and  Proverbs  16:18-20  explains  that  \"Pride  comes before destruction . . . and the one who trusts in the LORD will be happy.\" The fear of Yahweh and the knowledge of God seem to be parallel concepts (2:5).  The  bottom  line  is  that  a  personal  relationship  with  God  is  the  key  to wisdom. We fear him because he is the one who gives wisdom-it comes from his mouth, which also points us to the Word of God (2:6; cf. 30:5-6). In order to fear God and be wise, we must go to his Word and submit to its authority for our lives. In  Proverbs  30:1-6  Agur  acknowledges  that  he  is  not  wise-since  wisdom starts  with  recognizing  your  own  ignorance-and  that  wisdom  lies  in  heaven with God. No one has gone up to him to get wisdom. Wisdom belongs to him, "}
{"Page": 282, "Info": "and it belongs to his Son (30:4; Jesus!). Not only is wisdom found in the Son, but  it  is  also  found  in  God's  words  (30:5-6).42  God's  words  are  sufficient  to shape our lives; one does not need to add to them. The problem for our lives is that  we  often  try  to  add  to  God's  Word.  We  think  we  need  something  else  in addition to Scripture-something more relevant, practical, or helpful. \"Proverbs is not sufficient to inform my parenting; I need to grab a book from Books-A- Million  to  supplement  it.\"  \"Proverbs  cannot  really  tell  me  how  to  manage  my finances,  so  I  need  to  let  Dave  Ramsey  do  that.\"  I  am  not  saying  that  you shouldn't  read  other  resources,  but  the  lack  of  confidence  in  the  sufficiency  of God's Word among Christians is tragic. So we need God's Word to shape our worldview in order to observe the world through  that  lens.  We  need  to  view  the  world  through  the  lens  of  the  written Word and the living Word-Jesus of Nazareth ( John 1:1-18) (Goldsworthy, Tree of Life, 187). Otherwise, we cannot see how corrupted the world around us is. We hear this throughout Proverbs as it exhorts us to keep the commands, look to the law, and look to the prophets (29:18). Hamilton points out that the words used in this verse connect Proverbs with the rest of the Old Testament (i.e., the Law and the Prophets) since the words used here refer to the law of God and the visions of the prophets (God's Glory, 272). God must write the Word on our hearts through conversion,  but  our  responsibility  is  to  actively  bind  the  words  of  this  book around  our  neck,  write  them  on  our  hearts,  and  wrap  them  around  our  fingers, like  Old  Testament  Israel  (3:3;  cf.  Deut  6).  One  practical  way  to  do  this  is  to wear something on your wrist like a rubber band with a Bible reference written on it so you can be reminded constantly to meditate on it. Trusting  God  and  his  Word  brings  life.  Proverbs  28:14  states,  \"Happy  is  the one who is always reverent, but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.\" So there is blessing if you fear Yahweh, but if you reject him it will be disastrous. Trusting  the  Lord  prolongs  life,  whereas  folly  can  ruin  your  life  or  lead  to  a premature  death  (Fox,  Proverbs  1-9,  143).  Trusting  Yahweh  has  positive consequences  on  the  family  because  it  gives  your  children  a  refuge  (14:26).  It leads  to  not  having  anxiety  because  you  are  satisfied  in  the  Lord  (19:23). Trusting Yahweh leads to a good reputation, joy in life now, and eternal life in the  age  to  come.  So  recognize  that  prideful  insistence  that  you  always  know what is right is actually wrong, and humbly submit yourself to the Lord! Humbly Follow Godly Instruction and Counsel PROVERBS 10:8 "}
{"Page": 283, "Info": "Proverbs  tells  its  reader  that  godly  wisdom  is  often  mediated  through  human agents like parents. But it could also be applied to counselors, authority figures, or pastors. Foolishness means not submitting to these agents because you do not think  that  you  need  to,  because  in  your  pride  you  think  you  are  always  right. Wisdom means submitting to godly counsel that accords with the Word of God. You humbly submit to it because you know that you need it, need to learn more, and  need  to  learn  from  your  mistakes.  Proverbs  10:8  states,  \"A  wise  heart accepts commands, but foolish lips will be destroyed.\" One must recognize that correction is in your best interest, and that it is not in your self-interest to ignore counsel (though many if not most people act as though it is). The first place that a person is called to submit humbly is to their parents, as if they  are  obeying  the  Lord  himself  (1:8;  2:1;  3:1;  4:1,10;  etc.  cf.  Eph  6:1-2). Proverbs 13:1 says, \"A wise son responds to his father's discipline, but a mocker doesn't  listen  to  rebuke.\"  God  has  placed  this  authority  in  your  life  for  your good.  Wise  children  will  recognize  that  and  submit  to  their  parents'  authority, while  fools  will  refuse  to  listen  to  their  parents.  Fools  think  their  parents  are unwise  and  outdated,  but  you  will  learn  one  day  just  how  foolish  that  is.  The following  is  attributed  to  Mark  Twain,  although  its  provenance  is  unclear: \"When I was a boy of fourteen, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be twenty-one, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years.\" Someone might object, \"But I have ungodly parents!\" The Bible says we are still supposed to submit to ungodly authority that he has placed in our lives. Paul exhorts  the  church  at  Rome  to  submit  to  a  government  run  by  Nero,  who  is turning Christians into human candles to light his garden parties (Rom 13). The Bible  is  clear  that  unless  the  ordained  authority  in  your  life  is  forcing  you  to disobey God, you are to submit to it (Dan 3; 6; Acts 4). So listen to your parents when you are in their home because they have more experience and wisdom than you  do.  And  when  you  are  grown  and  out  of  the  house,  seek  their  counsel  on major decisions. Outside of parents' authority over their children, there are people in our lives who  are  either  authority  figures  or  can  be  counselors,  like  pastors  (Heb  13), bosses, teachers, and peer advisors in our church families. A great gift from God is a godly friend who will tell you what you need to hear, not just what you want to hear. We should all want people in our lives who can correct us because that is for our good. We are designed with a need for community-a church family. Proverbs  15:22  says  as  much:  \"Plans  fail  when  there  is  no  counsel,  but  with "}

{"Page": 285, "Info": "Conclusion We are programmed to reject the voice of God and listen to the wrong voice- usually  our  own!  It  has  been  this  way  since  Eden.  The  voice  of  the  serpent deceived  Eve  into  going  after  what  her  own  eyes  said  was  right  instead  of listening  to  the  word  of  God  (Gen  3).  That's  foolishness.  That  is  pride!  She rejected God's word, and instead she listened to the serpent's word and followed what her eyes said was wise. Trusting yourself and listening to Satan go hand-in- hand;  after  all,  pride  caused  his  fall  (Ezek  28:17).  Eve  sought  wisdom  and knowledge apart from the word of God, and it was destructive because it led to death.  She  became  the  arbiter  of  what  was  good  and  evil  instead  of  allowing God's word to determine those realities, and we've been doing it ever since. All of us have chosen to disobey God's word-we have chosen the wisdom of the world over God's word. But there is one man who did not give in to the temptation in the garden. He said  in  his  garden,  \"Not  what  I  want  but  what  you  want,\"  and  he  went  to  the cross. First Corinthians 1 tells us that act was foolishness to the world, but it's the  wisdom  and  power  of  God.  If  we  are  going  to  be  wise  in  God's  eyes,  that will  mean  looking  strange  in  the  eyes  of  the  world.  And  if  we  are  going  to  be wise,  that  means  humble  submission  to  the  one  who  is  God's  wisdom  and sanctification  for  us.  It  will  mean  having  the  mind  of  Jesus,  who  humbled himself  to  the  point  of  death-even  to  death  on  a  cross  (Phil  2:5-11).  So  fear Jesus and humbly walk in wisdom! "}
{"Page": 287, "Info": "Laziness PROVERBS 24:30-34 Main Idea: Our laziness points out our need for Jesus. I. Our Laziness Is Destructive. II. Our Laziness Points Us to Jesus. I n  a  song  titled  \"Down  the  Road\"  by  Mac  McAnally,  Kenny  Chesney  sings about a boy wanting to marry a girl and go through life together. In the third verse,  her  mother  wonders  if  the  boy  is  a  genuine  Christian,  but  her  father worries whether the boy has a good enough job to make it through married life. We hear that and think those are two very different concerns: Momma's is a very spiritual  (and  godly)  concern,  whereas  Daddy's  is  merely  a  material  concern. Wrong! Wanting to know if a man has a good enough work ethic to provide for your daughter is a very spiritual concern according to the Bible. Work is not a secular or neutral matter; it has everything to do with your walk with Christ! Proverbs says that sloth-laziness-is not just a character flaw, although it is. Proverbs mocks lazy people repeatedly as those who can't even bring their food to  their  mouths.  But  Proverbs  also  says  that  laziness  is  a  spiritual  problem! Proverbs warns the lazy and thereby calls them to repentance. I went by the field of a slacker and by the vineyard of one lacking sense. Thistles had come up everywhere, weeds covered the ground, and the stone wall was ruined. I saw, and took it to heart; I looked, and received instruction: a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to rest, and your poverty will come like a robber, and your need, like a bandit. (24:30-34) "}
{"Page": 288, "Info": "Our Laziness Is Destructive This passage pictures a wise man who sees the field of an idler. Literally the text says that the man \"lacks heart\" (v. 30 translated by CSB as \"lacking sense\"). To lack a heart in the Bible is a serious spiritual problem since it's associated with an  inability  to  obey  the  law  (Deut  5:29).  His  laziness  is  revealed  because  the field is overgrown with thorns. This language reminds one of the curse language of Genesis 3:17-19 where sin makes it difficult to work and provide, and where the ground bears \"thorns and thistles\" rather than fruit. Often, our sinful reaction to the curse is to take on as little responsibility as we can.  Many  become  couch  potatoes  or  lack  the  drive  to  work  hard.  The  slacker gives in to this temptation. He is not sweating, and he is not providing. He just lets the weeds grow and allows things to fall apart. The  sage  observes  this  and  is  instructed  by  it  (v.  32).  Wisdom  teaches  that there  is  an  order  to  the  world  so  that  it  works  in  a  certain  way.  We  see  this  in Proverbs  6  when  the  sage  observes  the  ants'  work  ethic  to  provide  and  store. While  you  can  observe  the  ant  to  see  that  a  work  ethic  is  helpful,  you  can observe  the  slacker  in  Proverbs  24  to  see  that  lazy  behavior  has  destructively negative  consequences.  Garrett  says,  \"The  anecdote  invites  the  reader  to  recall similar  observations  of  homes  in  disrepair  and  to  draw  the  same  conclusions\" (Proverbs, 202). The sage is pleading with us to not live against the grain because if  you  live  against  God's  design  of  the  world,  you  can  become  the  slob  on  the couch  who  is  dependent  on  handouts  (self-inflicted  poverty).  If  you  do  not  do what needs to be done, or if you sleep too much, then your life will be in chaos and more likely than not you will be poor and unable to provide. We need to be instructed by this as well and to be called to a strong work ethic that enables us to meet our family's needs. But  the  problem  for  us  is  that  when  we  read  these  verses  we  automatically think  of  the  thirty-five-year-old  sleeping  on  his  mommy's  and  daddy's  couch watching Jerry Springer while he stuffs his face with chips! Some of you may be struggling like that, but not most of us! That image enables you to say, \"I don't struggle with laziness!\" Yet we all have this tendency in our hearts, and we often do  not  recognize  it  because  we  measure  ourselves  against  people  whom  we know are lazy.43 Some of you may be struggling with wanting your needs met without having to work for them. Or you do not want to spend wisely; you just want to spend. Proverbs  20:4  says,  \"The  slacker  does  not  plow  during  planting  season;  at "}
{"Page": 289, "Info": "harvest  time  he  looks,  and  there  is  nothing.\"  As  a  result  of  this  lifestyle,  you depend  on  handouts-or  bailouts!  We  have  a  slothful  yet  entitled  society  that wants others to work for what they get. We even see this with people who drive from church to church in town to see if they can get money. And they know how to work the system. The problem is that is not most of us, and so we do not think we struggle with laziness. Some people have a problem not prioritizing what needs to be done over what we want to do! That's laziness too. This type of slothfulness is choosing to do what you want to do over what you need to do. Others have a life that is a mess because they are not taking control. They have a cluttered workspace and a car full  of  old  fast  food  wrappers.  Others  just  love  to  sleep  too  much.  That  is  a temptation for all of us because the God-ordained rhythm of work and rest can be abused. So get out of bed and get to work. However, for most people, their laziness is not a lack of activity; it's just the wrong kind of activity! Some people do not complete the tasks that are assigned to them or they do not finish them on time. Are you the kind of person who gets excited about new projects, but you do not complete them or you are having to constantly  ask  for  extensions?  Proverbs  12:27  talks  about  a  lazy  man  who \"doesn't roast his game.\" What an amazing picture! This person worked enough to get the meal-he did the hunt-but he will not work to finish it by cooking and preserving what he killed! Laziness can be the inability to finish tasks. Many  people  struggle  with  laziness  by  being  sidetracked  by  all  kinds  of diversions. Like the guy in the movie Office Space who says, \"In an average week, I'd say I only do about twenty minutes of real, actual work.\" Why? You don't work as much as you could because you are checking Facebook all day, passing around YouTube clips, or calling in sick when Call of Duty is released. An article a few  years  back  said  that  Angry  Birds  was  costing  businesses  $1.5  billion  in  lost wages  (Yarow,  \"Angry  Birds\").  When  I  posted  that  article,  a  Facebook  friend commented on my post by saying, \"At least 15 people I work with are playing Angry Birds continuously while they talk to customers 7 hours a day.\" Diversion is sloth, and Proverbs says of this kind of laziness, \"The one who works his land will  have  plenty  of  food,  but  whoever  chases  fantasies  lacks  sense\"  (12:11;  cf. 28:19). Some people just constantly procrastinate at work. They start assignments the day  before  they  are  due.  They  repeatedly  put  things  off  to  another  day. Procrastination  is  sloth.  Some  people  are  all  talk  and  little  action.  They  go  to meetings and make big plans, but they do not follow through in the end. It is the "}
{"Page": 290, "Info": "husband who constantly says to his wife, \"I'll fix that,\" but never gets around to it. Proverbs 14:23 says of this kind of laziness, \"There is profit in all hard work, but endless talk leads only to poverty.\" Do not say you will do something if you won't! Some people do not take the initiative to provide for their family. Maybe they try  to  avoid  child  support  payments,  or  maybe  they  claim  some  illegitimate disability to get out of work. That is not just wrong; it's ungodly. The Bible does not  condemn  those  who  are  laid  off  or  have  a  true  disability,  but  some  people just  make  excuses  to  avoid  work  or  to  delay  having  to  do  it!  Proverbs  26:13 hilariously  mocks  this  kind  of  sloth:  \"The  slacker  says,  \u2018There's  a  lion  in  the road-a  lion  in  the  public  square!'\"  This  guy  makes  a  \"thin  excuse\"  to  avoid work, but it seems legitimate to him (Longman, Proverbs, 468). I ( Jon) understand this. I used to get up at 4 a.m. to run with my youth pastor, but I would love the mornings it rained because it gave me an excuse not to run. It was the best of all worlds because I did not feel guilty about bailing, since \"I can't  do  it  today  anyway.\"  But  I  could  have  gone  to  the  gym  instead!  It  is  the same with excuses for work. People who ask for benevolence help often tell me, \"I'll do any job that's available. I just want to work.\" Then I say, \"OK. I know the  manager  at  the  grocery  store  over  on  Main.  I  can  get  you  a  job  tomorrow stocking shelves.\" Then they will say, \"Oh, I can't do that because I have a back problem.\" They say that they will do anything, but unless it is a desk job making sixty thousand dollars a year with full benefits, they shoot down every job idea I give them. That is an excuse to not work! The best scenario (in our own minds) is  to  be  able  to  convince  ourselves  that  we  are  hard  workers  without  having actually to expend the energy to be a hard worker. That is why Proverbs 26:16 says, \"In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser than seven who can answer sensibly.\" That is one of the keys about being lazy-you often do not know or think that you are! You think you are a hard worker when actually you are not. Laziness is a destructive path not just because it will embarrass you, although it  will,  and  not  just  because  it'll  make  it  difficult  for  you  to  give  your  family what they need, although it will, and not just because it'll make you a drain on the  people  around  you,  although  it  will  (10:26);  it  is  destructive  because ultimately it will send you to hell. The wages of laziness is death. The desire for ease, comfort, and avoiding work kills you. Proverbs 21:25 states, \"A slacker's craving will kill him because his hands refuse to work.\" Again, it may not turn out  that  way  immediately  because  some  lazy  people  inherit  wealth,  but  it  will turn out that way ultimately. "}
{"Page": 291, "Info": "Proverbs 15:19 says, \"A slacker's way is like a thorny hedge, but the path of the  upright  is  a  highway.\"  Again,  it  is  not  just  that  you  will  have  difficulty making your way in this life as a lazy person, although you will; but according to Proverbs there are two paths that lead to two different destinations. One leads to life  and  the  other  to  death,  and  laziness  is  the  path  to  hell.  Proverbs  18:9  says literally  that  a  lazy  person  is  a  brother  to  the  \"master  of  destruction,\"  so  you show  yourself  to  be  Satan's  brother  if  you  are  lazy.  Therefore,  judgment  will fall. Sloth is not just ridiculous; it is destructive! Our Laziness Points Us to Jesus Laziness  can  be  a  sign  of  not  being  born  again-lacking  the  new  heart-and needing to be transformed. This is why Paul says to deal with this in the church: if you don't work, you don't eat (2 Thess 3:10). And Paul says in 1 Timothy 5:8, \"But  if  anyone  does  not  provide  for  his  own  family,  especially  for  his  own household, he  has  denied  the faith  and is  worse than  an  unbeliever.\"  If  you  do not  have  a  work  ethic,  there  is  no  evidence  that  your  faith  is  real;  you  are  not believing the gospel. You may get up early, sit in your favorite chair, and read Scripture  for  an  hour,  but  if  you  constantly  procrastinate  on  your  work assignments or cannot complete tasks that are assigned to you, then you have a problem  with  Jesus  no  matter  how  long  your  quiet  time  is!  (Moore,  \"Finding Jesus\"). Solomon  again  points  us  to  Jesus-the  Wisdom  of  God  (1  Cor  1:30).  This pattern observed by the sage is centered on Christ, who upholds the world right now  by  his  word.  Your  work  ethic  shows  if  you  are  walking  toward  or  away from Jesus. That is, one way to know whether you are walking with Jesus is to look at your work ethic (1 Tim 5:8). The Wisdom of God on earth had a job as a carpenter. He learned and worked a trade! He also did the work his Father sent him to do. In John 4:34 Jesus says, \"My food is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work.\" And in John 17:4 Jesus says, \"I have glorified you on the  earth  by  completing  the  work  you  gave  me  to  do\"  (emphasis  added).  God worked to create the world and provide for humanity. He worked six days and finished his task, and then he rested. Jesus also worked six days of Holy Week, said \"It is finished\" on day six when he completed the work of new creation, and then  rested  in  the  garden  tomb  on  the  seventh  day.  As  N.  T.  Wright  poetically writes,  \"On  the  seventh  day  God  rested  in  the  darkness  of  the  tomb;  Having finished on the sixth day all his work of joy and doom\" (\"Easter Oratorio\"). He did this to provide for us what we cannot provide for ourselves. "}
{"Page": 292, "Info": "The proper response to laziness in our lives is to turn away from it and turn to Jesus,  who  perfectly  imaged  the  Father  by  working.  He  died  for  all  of  us  who fall short in our work ethic and offers us forgiveness and escape from hell. Then he transforms us by his Spirit into his image-the image of one who labors! God worked to create, produce, and provide food and a home for his children (Gen 1- 2). Part of being made in his image means that we do the same. We have failed, and the image is now distorted; but it is still there. Wisdom restores the image! Wisdom in Proverbs works to build creation (Prov 8) and a house (Prov 9). The New  Testament  reveals  that  Jesus  worked  to  create  the  world,  he  upholds  the universe  right  now  (Col  1;  Heb  1),  and  he  worked  to  make  all  things  new.  He prepares a home for his family ( John 14), and he feeds them ( John 6). Being saved means being conformed into the image of Christ, and that means work and production. All of this includes work in terms of vocation but also non-vocation. We are called  to  produce  and  not  just  to  consume  in  all  kinds  of  areas  of  our  lives. Proverbs talks about women who order the chaos and build homes (14:1; 31:10- 31). So tasks such as decorating, cleaning, consigning, and changing diapers are not  menial  but  rather  are  the  way  of  wisdom-the  way  of  Christ!  This  also means that in the body of Christ we are called to serve: keep the nursery, teach a Bible  study  class,  and  stack  some  chairs.  This  means  that  Christians  should  be the best employees. Managers and bosses around town should call local pastors and  ask  for  more  of  their  people  because  Christians  show  up  on  time,  stay  on task, and put in a good day's work. Work ethic is important for all kinds of reasons, and one reason is what God is preparing you for. Proverbs 12:24 says, \"The diligent hand will rule, but laziness will lead to forced labor.\" This does not just mean that you will be promoted if you work hard, though it is more likely you will. Humanity was called to rule the creation in the beginning, but we handed it over to the serpent. Solomon tells his son-a  son  who  will  rule  Israel-a  good  work  ethic  is  necessary  to  rule.  This principle  is  fulfilled  in  the  Greater  Solomon  who  rules  not  only  Israel  but  the whole world. He regains what was lost in Eden, and one day his kingdom will cover the entire cosmos. Jesus says that those who are faithful in the small things will be put in charge of many things (Matt 25). He says his followers will rule the universe with him, but in order to do that we are called to be faithful in the seemingly mundane things. As Russell Moore says, \"We are in an internship for the eschaton right now\" (\"Finding Jesus\").44 As you change diapers, take out the "}

Now in our fallen condition-in our lack of dominion over our lives-God calls us to look to the smallest of creeping things to learn from it: \"Go to the ant, you slacker!\" (6:6). This is an indictment that proves we need Jesus. We need to be made like him through the Gospel-made into the image of the one who said, \"It is finished!\" "}
{"Page": 296, "Info": "Wrath PROVERBS 20:22; 24:17-18; 25:21-22 Main Idea: You are freed from wrath when you trust in God's wrath. I. Avoid Being a Wrathful Person Because It Will Earn the Wrath of God (24:17-18). II. Trust in the Wrath of God (20:22; 25:21-22). H ello,  my  name  is  Inigo  Montoya.  You  killed  my  father.  Prepare  to  die!\" That is one of the great quotes in film history. It comes from the movie The Princess  Bride.  We  loved  watching  that  movie  as  kids,  especially  when  Inigo Montoya  gets  his  revenge  on  the  man  who  killed  his  father.  As  he  exacts  his vengeance, he finally gets to say the line that he has been repeating to himself his entire life! We  all  love  \"get  even\"  stories  because  injustice  makes  us  so  angry.  That  is why revenge stories and songs are so popular. I cannot help but smile when the Count  of  Monte  Cristo  coldly  pays  back  everyone  who  did  him  wrong.  People are  fascinated  by  shows  like  Maury  Povich's  when  he  brings  out  high  school nerds who are now good-looking and jacked with muscles to show off to those who  used  to  pick  on  them.  People  love  listening  to  songs  like  Carrie Underwood's  \"Before  He  Cheats,\"  or  \"Two  Black  Cadillacs,\"  or  Toby  Keith's \"How Do You Like Me Now?\" Keith sings about someone who made fun of him in  high  school  but  now  wakes  up  to  an  alarm  in  the  morning  hearing  Keith's song on the radio. How can we not help but feel some glee in these bits of pop culture? The reason we resonate with these movies, shows, and songs is because we all know  what  it  is  like  to  be  wronged  or  for  someone  we  love  to  have  been wronged. Many people know what it is like to be bullied and made fun of. There are names that you can still hear today that you have not been called for twenty years,  and  just  hearing  that  name  still  turns  your  stomach.  Many  people  have experienced  broken  promises  or  the  abandonment  of  a  parent,  been  abused  by someone  they  trusted,  cheated  on,  or  gossiped  about.  You  may  have  been abandoned,  raped,  abused,  or  stabbed  in  the  back  by  a  friend,  and  you  still experience deep pain. "}
{"Page": 297, "Info": "Since we all know what it is like to be wronged or for someone we love to be wronged, we all love the revenge story. There is a sense in which we should love these stories: we are born with an innate sense of justice because we have been made in the image of a God who is just. That is why we get really angry when people get away with doing what is wrong or get off on a technicality, especially if  it  is  someone  we  love  who  was  hurt.  We  want  the  offender  to  get  what  is coming to him. We want justice to be done! Since  we  are  made  in  the  image  of  a  God  who  is  just,  and  since  wanting justice to be done  is not wrong,  why does God condemn wrath and  bitterness? The  problem  we  have  is  not  the  desire  for  justice  to  be  done.  The  problem  we have is the desire to be the ones who execute the justice, when that job belongs to God alone. Our sense of justice is right, but trying to be the one who executes it is wrong because it is an attempt to take God's place. When you refuse to lay down a grudge, you reveal that you do not trust that God is able to deal with an injustice to your satisfaction. We see this truth throughout the book of Proverbs. People are wrathful because they do not trust the wrath of God to make things right. Avoid Being a Wrathful Person Because It Will Earn the Wrath of God PROVERBS 24:17-18 Proverbs  10:12  says,  \"Hatred  stirs  up  conflicts,  but  love  covers  all  offenses.\" Therefore,  according  to  Proverbs,  being  a  wrathful,  vengeful,  bitter,  angry, quick-tempered,  unforgiving  person  is  the  path  of  foolishness.  In  contrast, wisdom means being a patient person who is slow to anger and quick to forgive (14:29).  Holding  on  to  grudges  and  seeking  to  get  even  are  condemned throughout the book. Forgiveness and mercy are encouraged. The  problem  is  that  we  think  since  we  never  took  a  Louisville  Slugger  to someone's car that we are not wrathful people. Yet there are all kinds of ways to be a wrathful person. For some, they just have a kind of cold silence. They might say,  \"If  you  don't  know  what  you  did,  then  I'm  not  going  to  tell  you.\"  For others, they just let things fester with their spouse because they think that if they don't act mad, he will think that what he did is no big deal. Some try to lash out with bad behavior, like looking to someone other than their spouse for affection in order to teach their spouse a lesson. Some might just imagine in their mind, If that person who hurt me were sick or dead, my life would be happier. "}
{"Page": 298, "Info": "Proverbs  mentions  all  kinds  of  ways  people  try  to  get  even  that  do  not necessarily  include  violence.  Some  respond  to  an  insult  from  someone  else  by crafting  a  great  comeback.  Some  lash  out  by  gossiping  about  others.  For example,  in  one  of  Taylor  Swift's  songs  where  she  is  done  wrong  by  a boyfriend, she tells him that she will tell everyone else that he is gay. Proverbs calls  us  to  another  path.  Proverbs  17:9  says,  \"Whoever  conceals  an  offense promotes love, but whoever gossips about it separates friends.\" People try to get even  by  constantly  bringing  up  past  wrongs  done  to  them  and  refusing  to  let them  go.  Some  just  blow  up  in  a  fury  and  lose  their  temper  with  their  wife, husband,  or  children  by  saying  things  they  should  not  say  and  do  not  really mean.  It  damages  their  relationships  and  ability  to  share  intimacy.  Instead, Proverbs 17:27 urges, \"The one who has knowledge restrains his words, and one who keeps a cool head is a person of understanding.\" So instead of gossiping or losing our temper or making lists of wrongs done to us, we are called to be cool- headed and let go of offenses done to us! For some of us, we can ease any guilt we might feel over our bitterness with the fact that \"I never acted on it.\" But even if you never act on it, bitterness- which starts in the heart, in our thought life-is still sin. Further, what starts in the  heart  may  not  stay  in  the  heart.  Proverbs  20:22  states,  \"Don't  say,  \u2018I  will avenge  this  evil!'  Wait  on  the  LORD,  and  he  will  rescue  you.\"  The  verse references talking to yourself-planning that starts in the heart. The intent to get even starts in the heart, and is accountable to God, even if you never act on it. Jesus says the same thing in Matthew 5! Some of us don't do anything except get happy when things go bad for those who hurt us. When they lose their job, struggle in their relationships, or have a bit  of  \"bad  luck,\"  it  makes  our  day  a  little  brighter.  Proverbs  24:17-18  warns about that reality: \"Don't gloat when your enemy falls, and don't let your heart rejoice when he stumbles, or the LORD will see, be displeased, and turn his wrath away from him.\" It's not just that people will not like you if you are a vengeful person, although that is true, but you also will go to hell for gloating. You will receive the wrath of God. Why? Proverbs 24 says that your lack of forgiveness is as  much  a  sin-condemnable  before  God-as  what  they  did  to  you.  That  is  a hard truth, but it is the truth, especially for believers who have been forgiven so much. Duane  Garrett  writes,  \"It  seems  perverse  to  refrain  from  gloating  so  that Yahweh might further injure your enemy\" (Proverbs, 199). That may seem like a twisted bit of advice from the sage: you refrain, you forgive, and then that person "}
{"Page": 299, "Info": "will  get  what's  coming  to  him!  Some  might  think  that  doesn't  sound  like  a Christian motive. As John Piper points out, we need to be careful thinking that because  Jesus  had  that  motive.  That  is  a  Christian  motive  for  being  free  from wrath (\"Future Grace, Part 4\").45 For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps. He did not commit sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth; when he was insulted, he did not insult in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten but entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. (1 Pet 2:21-23) These verses answer the big practical question that hurt people have: How can I forgive? How can I let it go? How can I act like nothing really happened to me while they get away scot-free? The answer to that question is follow the example of Jesus and hand justice over to God! You trust God to handle it! Jesus, the Wisdom of God, calls us to this: love your enemies, pray for those who  persecute  you,  turn  the  other  cheek,  and  do  not  revile!  He  is  not  some absentee Master who says, \"Do what I say, not what I do!\" He understands. It is not  like  a  husband  giving  his  wife  advice  on  enduring  the  pain  of  childbirth. Jesus knows what he is talking about because he has been wronged in a greater way than you or I ever could be! He carried his cross, got punched in the face, and  was  whipped,  stripped  naked,  and  mocked  by  taunts:  \"If  you  are  really God's  Son,  come  down  off  that  cross!\"  And  when  he  went  through  that,  Jesus looked  into  the  faces  of  his  murderers  and  mockers  and  said,  \"Father,  forgive them, because they do not know what they are doing\" (Luke 23:34). We might be  tempted  to  think  Jesus  was  wimpy  in  that  moment  and  is  calling  us  to  be wimpy  like  he  is,  but  that  would  be  wrong.  Jesus  is  no  wimp.  He  trusted  the justice of God! It takes more toughness not to retaliate and to wait for judgment day!  Proverbs  24  says  that  if  we  fail  to  trust  in  God's  wrath  for  the  day  of judgment, we will experience that wrath ourselves on judgment day! So, again, what is the antidote to wrath? Trust in the Wrath of God PROVERBS 20:22; 25:21-22 People  believe  that  forgiveness  is  the  right  course  of  action  in  every  case  with one exception-mine! Our hearts are warmed by forgiveness stories, but we all think  that  our  situation  is  just  a  little  bit  different.  We  think,  You  could  not  possibly expect me to forgive him or her after what he or she did to me. How can I forgive a father who killed my mother, a dad who took advantage of me, or a spouse who walked out on me? How?  How  do  you  forgive  those  who  have  really  wronged  you?  It  is  really hard because our biggest fear is that if we let this go, it will be like what they did "}
{"Page": 300, "Info": "to me was no big deal. The answer is to follow in the path of Jesus and trust in the wrath of God that they will get what is rightfully and justly coming to them. Proverbs 20:22 states, \"Don't say, \u2018I will avenge this evil!' Wait on the LORD, and he will rescue you.\" The Bible calls us away from vigilante or self-produced justice. People resonate with vigilantes like Zorro, Batman, Dexter, or the Count of  Monte  Christo  because  we  want  justice  to  be  done.  But  these  stories  are stories of unbelief. Real forgiveness is a belief issue. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and it is still the beginning of wisdom when it comes to bitterness and forgiveness. You trust God to redress what has happened to you. You free yourself of bitterness by trusting that God will avenge you. In Romans 12:19  the  Lord  says,  \"Vengeance  is  mine.  I  will  repay\"  (author's  translation). There is no timetable given, but there is certainty that it will happen. No matter how long it takes, you trust that God will set things right in the end. Proverbs goes a step further. It does not just forbid revenge. Resisting the urge to  take  revenge  is  obviously  a  good  step  and  something  we  are  called  to accomplish, but  often that can be done through an act of willpower or  through just lacking the energy or the opportunity to get back at somebody. No, Proverbs goes  a  step  further  when  it  says  do  good  to  those  who  have  wronged  you. Proverbs 25:21-22 says-and Paul quotes this in Romans 12-\"If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink; for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you.\" Why should you do good to those who have hurt you? You do so because it heaps  burning  coals  on  their  heads.  What  does  that  mean?  Two  options  are possible.  First,  this  statement  may  be  a  metaphor  for  repentance  similar  to  an Egyptian  repentance  ritual  where  a  thief  carried  a  basket  of  fiery  coals  on  his head  as  a  sign  of  shame.  Thus,  your  mercy  toward  them  may  shame  them  and lead  to  their  repentance  and  reconciliation  with  God  and  you.  Or  second,  this statement means that your good deeds will bring even greater judgment on those who  wronged  you.  Given  the  way  Paul  quotes  this  in  Romans  12,  the  second option is better. Psalm 11:6 aids this interpretation as well because burning coals refers to God's judgment: \"Let him rain burning coals and sulfur on the wicked; let a scorching wind be the portion in their cup.\"46 Therefore, your good deeds lead to greater judgment because in many ways your forgiveness and mercy have displayed  the  cross  to  them,  and  instead  of  repenting  they  have  hardened  their hearts.  So  we  forgive  and  do  good  to  those  who  hurt  us  because  it  will  either lead to their repentance or to their judgment. Either way, God will make things right. "}
{"Page": 301, "Info": "The problem for many of us is that we think forgiveness and love of enemies are  for  really  good  Christians-like  varsity-level  Christians.  Or  we  think  our case  is  different.  How  can  you  expect  me  to  forgive  the  people  who  made  my life a living hell? But the Bible says if you do not forgive, you probably are not a Christian.  Jesus  says  in  Matthew  6:14-15,  \"For  if  you  forgive  others  their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you as well. But if you don't forgive others,  your  Father  will  not  forgive  your  offenses.\"  And  if  you  do  not  have God's forgiveness, that means hell! These verses are not saying that you have to be a good person to go to heaven or to get God's forgiveness. They are saying that unforgiveness shows that you do  not  believe  the  gospel.  Bitter  people  go  to  hell  not  because  they  are  not working hard enough for God, but because they do not trust God to work hard enough for them. The  bottom  line  is  that  if  we  are  wrathful  people  it  is  because  we  do  not believe the gospel. There are two possibilities for the people who have wronged us  (Piper,  \"Future  Grace,  Part  4\").  First,  if  it  is  a  Christian  who  hurt  us,  Jesus drowned in his own blood to pay for the sin he or she committed against us. God has not swept what that person did to us under the rug of the universe. He has dealt with it. He took what that person did so seriously that he killed his Son for it. If you hold a grudge, essentially you are saying that the cross of Jesus Christ is enough to forgive the sins that you have committed against God, but it is not enough  to  forgive  the  sins  committed  against  you.  That  is  a  failure  to  truly believe the gospel. Ephesians 4:32 says that we are to forgive because we have been forgiven, and our  offenses  against  God  are  far  greater  than  anyone's  offense  against  us.  So forgive.  Be  patient  in  traffic.  Do  not  blow  up  in  anger  against  your  children. Jesus  has  been  infinitely  patient  and  merciful  to  you.  Do  good  to  your  enemy, and it may lead to their repentance and faith in Jesus Christ, who paid for every sin that person committed against you. Second, if it is a non-Christian who hurt you, he or she will pay for those sins forever in hell. If the person who hurt you remains unrepentant, he will suffer for eternity. You do not have to add to that sentence one second of your fury. God does not need your help to carry out that punishment. Therefore, let go of your grudges, forgive those who hurt you, pray for those who  have  wronged  you,  do  good  to  your  enemy,  and  do  not  insist  on  always having  the  last  word.  The  way  you  live  that  kind  of  life  is  by  constantly preaching  the  gospel  to  yourself  in  those  moments  when  your  anger  begins  to "}

When they see crazy people who  forgive  drunk  drivers  who  killed  their  children  or  a  wife  who  forgives terrorists who gunned down her missionary husband, then maybe they will start to see Jesus. Until then, they see people who are just like them. After all, Jesus says even lost people do good to those who are good to them (Matt 5:43-47). "}

Peter  saw  this  firsthand  (  John  18).  When  the  mob  came  for  Jesus,  Peter took up his sword and cut off a man's ear. Jesus told Peter to put the sword away because he did not need Peter's help. Jesus could call the armies of heaven and they would respond to his voice, but Jesus was able to be non-wrathful because he  knew  God's  wrath  needed  to  come  down  and  be  poured  out  on  him  at Golgotha. And Jesus knew that one day he would split the eastern sky and return to exact vengeance on all the enemies of God. Every injustice will be set right- bank on it! On that day he will not need your help or my help. As Russell Moore says, \"He will say, \u2018No need for swords, boys. I can take it from here'\" (\"Why Jesus\"). "}
